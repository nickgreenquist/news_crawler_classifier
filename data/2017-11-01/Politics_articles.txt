Democratic group pulls ad targeting Virginia governor hopeful Ed Gillespie's supporters:::::A television ad depicting supporters of Virginia gubernatorial hopeful Ed Gillespie as Confederates who attack children of color has been pulled in the wake of the terror attack in New York City.The Democratic group Latino Victory Fund removed the controversial ad, which showed a pickup truck driver chasing down children of color on Tuesday, Oct. 31.We knew our ad would ruffle feathers.We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they dont like what they see.We have decided to pull our ad at this time, said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the LVF, in a statement on Twitter Tuesday evening.Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.The statement was released just hours after investigators said the suspected driver, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan.The incident, being treated as a terror attack, left at least eight dead and at least 11 others injured.The ad was released on Monday and was expected to run through Election Day.Gillespie denounced the ad Tuesday morning in an interview with Fox & Friends.This attack is not just an attack on my supporters, its an attack on all Virginians.The fact is, whether you disagree with people or not, in Virginia, we respect civil discourse and this is a new low in politics here.Its a sad day, Gillespie said.In a statement to Fox News, Gillespies campaign manager called the ad a desperate smear campaign.
Diversity visa program: What you need to know:::::The terror attack Tuesday in Lower Manhattan has brought renewed calls from President Trump and other top Washington Republicans to end the "diversity visa" program under which the central Asian suspect entered the United States.Ive always been against it because its a random system to bring people into the United States, Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Wednesday on Fox News Fox & Friends.McCaul said hes trying to abolish the roughly 25-year-old program and replace it with a merit-based one.I think this case just demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary, he also said.The suspect in Tuesdays terror attack, Sayfullo Saipov, came into the U.S. in 2010 from Uzbekistan.He was among the maximium 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the State Department program, which tilts toward countries with historically low rates of immigration.The 29-year-old Saipov on Tuesday afternoon drove a rented pickup truck down a walk-bike path along Manhattans West Side Highway, killing eight and injuring at least 11 others, according to police.McCaul spoke Wednesday just minutes after President Trump called for a merit-based only immigration system and in part blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats for the program.The terrorist came into our country through what is called the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based, Trump tweeted.No more Democratic lottery, Trump said in a follow-up tweet.Schumer indeed voted in support of the 1990 Immigration Act, which included the diversity visa program.The New York Democrat was then a House member and among those who helped pass the measure 264-118, with support from 93 Republicans in the chamber.The bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush and took effect in 1995.Slightly more than 1 million people have entered the U.S. under the program, based on an analysis of State Department records.At least 24,000 people have entered the country from Uzbekistan since 2005, according to the records.The program, which has its origins in a 1986 special-preference program, requires applicants to have no criminal record and come from a county not on the list for statesponsored terrorism.However, critics have for years argued that potential terrorists can easily move from their birth county to a country not on the list such as Congo, Niger and Turkey.They also argue that immigrants can come into the U.S. without paying a cent.Lets focus on economic rather that literally handing out tens of thousands of visas like lottery tickets, for free, Fox contributor and former Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday.Congress tried unsuccessfully several times since 2005 to end the program, including a 2007 attempt to cut off its funding.Such efforts, led in part by Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, followed a 2002 terror attack at the Los Angeles International Airport in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian nationalist, fatally shot two people.Like Saipov, Hadayet entered the U.S. under the diversity visa program.
DOJ, FBI show House investigators documents on anti-Trump 'dossier':::::The Justice Department and FBI showed classified documents related to the controversial anti-Trump dossier to congressional investigators behind closed doors Tuesday, Fox News has learned.Investigators from the House Intelligence Committee are seeking to learn how much, if at all, federal law enforcement officers have relied on the dossier since it was compiled by the research firm Fusion GPS, with funding from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, in mid-2016.The documents reviewed Tuesday were presented for inspection pursuant to a subpoena issued by the committee's chairman, U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. Republican staffers say they were not allowed to make copies of the documents they saw, but were only permitted to review them on-site and take notes.Other officials told Fox that Nunes rebuffed the Justice Department's offer to bring the documents to the Capitol, saying he only wanted his staffers to view the documents and not take copies away.Capitol Hill sources told Fox News that U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the committee's ranking member, attended the session at the Justice Department -- as did two staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Two Republican committee staffers and two Democratic committee staffers also attended.Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee consider the attendance of Schiff and Pelosi's staffers to be a notable change of tune for the Democrats, who have long insisted there was no need to investigate the dossier.Neither Pelosi's office nor Schiff's office immediately responded to requests for comment.The sources also said the session grew contentious after the Democrats slowed down the process with numerous questions.However, other officials said the meeting grew contentious only after Schiff became upset that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had been notified about the session before Schiff.Ryan did not attend, nor did he send any members of his staff.Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.
Russia probe reveals the gang that couldn't collude straight:::::The fascinating thing when a scandal erupts is that everyone in America becomes an expert on prosecutorial tactics, defense strategy and criminal evidence.Suddenly, it seems, all the armchair lawyersincluding every journalist with a pulse--are debating the significance of the previously obscure George Papadopoulos.What strikes me is that for those characters in the Trump orbit who were interested in colluding with Russia, they werent very good at it.Not much, as far as we know now, ever got done.For instance, Papadopoulos said in one email that he had been introduced to Vladimir Putins niece.Except that, as a brief online search would have revealed, Putin doesnt have a niece.This isnt to suggest that Robert Mueller shouldnt try to unravel whatever contacts took place between Trump associates and the Russians, if only to shed light on what didnt happen as well as what did.While the indictments of Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates dominated the headlines, only the guilty plea by Papadopoulos is linked to the campaign and Russia.Papadopoulos was an unpaid, low-level, London-based foreign policy adviseryes, Trump called him excellent in a meeting at the Washington Postwho kept sending his superiors without getting much traction.Its certainly fair to say he was open to colluding with Russia, now that hes been charged with lying to the FBI.Papadopoulos was touting the idea that he might be able to broker a Trump-Putin meeting, which was ludicrous and, of course, never happened.The Post has identified some of the people not named in the agreement, such as Sam Clovis, Trumps national co-chairman, listed as Papadopoulos supervisor.Clovis told him "great work" when he floated his efforts to meet the Russian ambassador, which Papadopoulos never did.He also reported meeting Putins non-existent niece.From the Post: "In August 2016, Clovis responded to efforts by Papadopoulos to organize an 'off the record' meeting with Russian officials.'I would encourage you' and another foreign policy adviser to the campaign to 'make the trip, if it is feasible,' Clovis wrote."Victoria Toensing, Clovis' attorney, told the Post that he "always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign" and that his responses were a courtesy by "a polite gentleman from Iowa."The Post also says that Papadaopoulos sent several Russia-related emails to Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager.There is no indication that he responded, other than one note referring him to Clovis.Lewandowski told the "Today" show that "George was a low-level volunteer" and that he didnt recall receiving any specific emails from him, as he was deluged with thousands of messages a day.He said he would be happy to talk to investigators but has not been interviewed.One other person named by the Post was Manafort, who forwarded a Papadopoulos email to another campaign official, saying: "We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips" to Russia."It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."Oh, and "the Professor" that Papadopoulos said had links to Russia and was proffering "dirt" on Hillary Clinton, including "thousands of emails"?Scottish professor Joseph Mifsud told the Daily Telegraph that he knew nothing about digging up Hillary dirt and that it was a "laughing stock" to say he had introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian female national.Earlier, Mifsud told the Post that he had "absolutely no contact" with the Russian government: "I am an academic, I do not even speak Russian."So Papadopoulos appears to have been a lousy colluder.Its reminiscent of the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. set up with the Russian lawyer who was said to have promised dirt on Clinton.That session, also attended by Manafort and Jared Kushner, appears to have produced nothing.Well learn more as the Mueller probe unfolds.But for now, while these fledgling attempts at getting oppo research from Moscow look bad, it seems they were a bust.
Milo Yiannopoulos speech at Cal State Fullerton: Seven arrested:::::At least seven people were arrested Tuesday after violence broke out between protesters and counter-protesters attending an event by provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at California State University, Fullerton.The speech attracting 800 attendees drew multiple protesters who chanted slogans such as Black lives matter!and Cops and the Klan go hand in hand!Some had signs reading, Immigrants in, racists out, and Only socialist revolution can defeat capitalist reaction.Claudia Brick, a 66-year-old woman protesting Yiannopoulos, said she hoped to get her message across.We believe in their right to free speech as well, but we believe we can get our message across louder, and there are certainly more of us," she said.A post shared by MILO (@milo.yiannopoulos) on Oct 31, 2017 at 8:33pm PDT At least two people were arrested for scuffles, according to university spokesman Jeff Cook.It remained unclear why other people were arrested.The police took extra precautions to ensure safety at the event.Additional police officers were brought from other agencies and helicopters hovered around the area, the Los Angeles Times reported.Some police officers were seen wearing riot gear, others were on horseback, and several officers were on the event venues rooftop.Most protesters remained peaceful but the demonstration got heated after a woman punched a female Yiannopoulos supporter several times before someone restrained her with pepper spray.A post shared by MILO (@milo.yiannopoulos) on Oct 31, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT The attacked woman, Genevieve Peters, said a female protester carrying a baby attacked her after she told the woman she needed to be careful with the toddler at the protest."She came and just punched me in the side of the head, and came running after me, and my friends had to get her off," said Peters, describing herself as a proud supporter of President Donald Trump."She tried to punch me three or four times.I feel sorry for her because she has so much anger."The attacker quickly disappeared from the scene, but it remained unclear whether she was among the two arrested for violence.Another woman, wearing a black helmet and a mask, was arrested after shooting pepper spray into the air.She was heard agitating demonstrators to storm the Yiannopoulos event and beat him up, the L.A. Times reported.Most violence was recorded prior the event, with only small arguments erupting in the aftermath.The event was the speaker's first big appearance on a U.S. college campus after the highly anticipated Free Speech Week at UC Berkeley fell apart amid disorganization.Yiannopoulos' event at Fullerton was organized by the College Republicans, who invited the speaker as a way to draw attention to the existence of conservative students at the college and the need for free speech."We really just felt left out of the conversations on campus as conservatives, and bringing him has really started this conversation about free speech," said Brooke Paz, a spokeswoman for the group.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Michigan official charged in deadly Flint water crisis heads back to court:::::The director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is expected back in state court for a preliminary hearing Wednesday, as a judge weighs whether he should face criminal liability for his role in the Flint water crisis.Nick Lyon was charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office in connection with a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires disease in the Flint region in 2015.Lyon is accused of causing the death of a Flint man on Dec. 13, 2015, by failing to warn the public of the potential danger posed by the disease in a timely manner.The citys water supply was switched to the Flint River in April 2014.Within months, Flint began issuing advisories for residents to boil their water due to sanitary concerns.On Dec. 14, 2015, the citys mayor declared a state of emergency because of elevated lead levels in the Flint drinking water.The preliminary hearing will determine whether there is enough evidence for prosecutors to bring the case against Lyon, who oversaw the events leading to the crisis, to trial.Judge David Goggins has not heard testimony since Oct. 6, when urban affairs adviser Harvey Hollins said he told Gov.Rick Snyder about a Legionnaires outbreak several weeks before the governor made it public in January 2016.That testimony contradicted what Snyder previously told the U.S. House Oversight Committee under oath in March 2016.Lyon is seeking to have the conflicting testimony thrown out on the grounds that it is irrelevant to the criminal case against him, according to WJRT.Former Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley has criticized the case against Lyon.Its wrong for this particular charge to be brought against Nick Lyon, whos got nothing to do with making the decision --- its just wrong, and he wont escape the stigma of it even if hes found innocent, he said, according to the Detroit Free Press.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
Paul Manafort considered flight risk because of wealth, foreign connections: special counsel:::::Just one day after pleading not guilty to a 12-count indictment, Paul Manafort was described as a major flight risk by prosecutors because of his wealth and international connections.According to court documents unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors say they believe Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- and his business associate Richard Gates were at risk of fleeing.The defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections, the court documents read.Manafort is known to have a significant amount of wealth.Between 2012 and 2016, he listed his assets to be between $19 million and $136 million, the New York Daily News reported.His financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely, Tuesdays documents revealed.The 68-year-old was also being considered a flight risk because of his foreign connections.The Washington Post reported that Manafort keeps three U.S. passports and has submitted 10 passport applications in recent years.Prosecutors note in the documents that Manafort also has wealthy ties to Moscow and to Kiev, Ukraine, through his previous business dealings.His travel schedule in the last year reveals the many connections Manafort has overseas, increasing the possibility of flight, prosecutors said.The court documents even brought up Manaforts age, stating he might be more inclined to flee with a guilty verdict carrying a sentence of around 12 to 15 years.Manafort pleaded not guilty Monday after being indicted on 12 counts by a federal grand jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election.The special counsels office told Fox News that the counts include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.Manaforts bail was set at $10 million.He will return to court Thursday to hear the terms of his bail.
House Republicans postpone tax reform rollout:::::House Republicans have pushed back the release of their tax reform plan after failing to finalize last-minute changes to the legislation, the head of the tax-writing committee confirmed Tuesday.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said the decision to postpone the rollout was made "in consultation with President Trump and our leadership team.""We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week," Brady added.The details of the plan were initially scheduled to be unveiled on Wednesday, and Brady had promised as recently as 4 p.m.ET Tuesday that would be the case.The committee had worked throughout the day and evening to produce a plan for the first overhaul of the nation's tax code in three decades.Although they had settled on some key details such as a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and maintaining the top personal income tax rate for the wealthy of 39.6 percent other elements still had to be resolved.Late Tuesday, reporters in the hall outside the committee's office could hear raised voices as members appeared to be arguing.Trump has intensified his lobbying for the nearly $6 trillion tax overhaul plan, seeking a major legislative achievement after the collapse of the health care repeal.Late Tuesday, Trump renewed his cheerleading on Twitter.The plan originally unveiled by Trump and congressional Republicans called for shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent.That plan drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who complained it was too favorable to the wealthy and undermined Trump's rhetoric about it benefiting the middle class.Brady did not answer directly when he was asked -- while leaving House Speaker Paul Ryan's suite Tuesday -- whether the drop in the corporate tax rate would happen immediately.But, he said: "I want as much growth right from Day One as I can."Trump and congressional Republicans are eager for a significant legislative achievement after failing in their attempts to repeal the Obama-era health care law.Enacting a tax package is deemed critical for the Republicans to maintain their majorities in the 2018 elections.Trump said he's directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and other administration officials to stay behind when he heads for Asia on Friday so they can help sell the tax proposal.The White House said Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser, had canceled plans to accompany the president to China and South Korea to help push the package.The president said he was hopeful the House will approve the tax bill by Thanksgiving and that he can sign it into law by Christmas.But his overly optimistic timetable didn't address the concerns of lawmakers from states such as New York and New Jersey who have opposed a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes, arguing it would hurt their constituents and subject them to being taxed twice.A battle continues over contributions to 401(k) retirements accounts.The financial industry and some Republican lawmakers insist that the GOP plan not change the tax benefits of the popular savings vehicles, as has been floated by GOP leaders.The current Republican plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit.In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, it also seeks to repeal inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy.Fox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
NYC attack: Trump calls for stronger 'extreme vetting':::::Following the terror attack in New York City Tuesday, President Trump said he ordered the Department of Homeland Security to "step up" the nation's "extreme vetting program.""I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program," Trump tweeted Tuesday night."Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!"Trump initially reacted to the terror attack in Lower Manhattan by saying it was done by a sick and deranged person.In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person, the president tweeted.Law enforcement is following this closely.NOT IN THE U.S.A.!Authorities said at least eight people died and 11 were injured after a driver plowed into a bike path in New York on Tuesday afternoon.Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was shot by police and taken into custody following the attack."My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack," Trump later tweeted."God and your country are with you!"Meanwhile, the president vowed to stop the Islamic State from executing terror attacks in the United States."We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere," Trump said."Enough!"Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president has been briefed on the attack by chief of staff John Kelly and will be updated as more details are known.Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected, Sanders said.First lady Melania Trump also tweeted that her heart breaks for her hometown.My heart breaks for #NYC today, she tweeted.Thoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation.The FBI is investigating the incident as terrorism, Fox News has learned.It is being jointly investigated by both the New York Police Department and the FBI.The Department of Homeland Security said its acting secretary, Elaine Duke, has also been briefed on the apparent act of terrorism and is closely monitoring the situation and working with our federal, state and local partners in responding to and investigating this tragedy.We have recently seen attacks like this one throughout the world, the department said in a news release.DHS and its law enforcement partners remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding the American people.Fox News Jake Gibson contributed to this report.
Russian trolls and bots disrupting US democracy via Facebook and Twitter:::::There was the ISIS attack on a chemical plant in southern Louisiana last September.Two months later, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus occurred in Atlanta on the same day a video began circulating on social media of an unarmed black woman being shot to death by police in the Georgia city.What all these shocking and disparate stories have in common are two things: they are not true and they all originated from a group of Russian cyber trolls working out of a non-descript office building in St. Petersburg.In addition, throughout last years presidential election season, dozens of stories circulated on Twitter, Facebook and other social media attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton about everything from supposedly having poor mental health to allegedly fostering secret ties with Islamic extremists.With top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google testifying Tuesday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Russias attempts to influence U.S. elections and sow discord across the country via social media, many questions remain about how these Russian trolls operate, the veracity of the so-called news they are spreading and what tech giants in Silicon Valley are doing to combat this scourge.Were pretty sure Russia is behind this given that weve seen the building they use, know that theyve put hundreds of millions of dollars into this effort and that they have about 200 employees working on this, Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford and research director of the Oxford Internet Institute, told Fox News.The problem combatting them is different with each social media platform.On the worlds most popular social media site, Facebook, Russian trolls use fake names and backgrounds paired with stolen photos to pose as American citizens and spread either false news stories or hacked information.In one instance, an account under the name of Melvin Reddick of Harrisburg, Pa. last June posted a link to a website called DCLeaks, which displayed material stolen from a number of prominent American political figures.While the information posted on the site appeared to be true, Reddick was an apparition with no records in Pennsylvania appearing under his name and his photos taken from an unsuspecting Brazilian.While trolls in Russia have also used individual accounts on Twitter to disseminate false or incendiary news, the more common practice implemented on that platform is so-called bot farming, where a series of up to hundreds and at times thousands of automated accounts will send out identical messages seconds apart and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names.On Election Day last year, a group of bots on Twitter blasted out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.Experts say that while these trolls may use various methods to try and disguise their Russian identities, such as changing their IP addresses, they are easily tracked by their frequent screw-ups (some accidently put their location setting on in Twitter, use credit cards linked to the Russian government or write their posts in Cyrillic).Preventing them from operating, however, is a different story.Groups like Hoffmans Oxford Internet Institute say that they can monitor questionable accounts and alert tech companies, but to really make progress and to openly prove that Russia is behind these attacks Facebook and Twitter need to be more transparent.The only way to see if these accounts are actually Russian is for Facebook and Twitter to be more open and tell us, Hoffman said.That is why these testimonies are so important.The testimony from Facebook, obtained before the company went before the Senate, revealed that posts generated by Russia's Internet Research Agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users between January 2015 and August 2017.Twitter was expected to tell the same subcommittee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the same group, Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.Twitter believes that any activity of that kindregardless of magnitudeis unacceptable, and we agree that we must do better to prevent it, a source familiar with Twitters testimony, said in an email to Fox News.State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for usand one that we are determined to meet.Despite the more than 2,700 accounts linked to Russia being nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, the company the number of accounts linked to Russia and that were Tweeting election-related content was small in comparison to the total number of accounts, on the social media site, the person familiar with the testimony said, adding they did not rig the election in favor of President Trump.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee holding the hearing, said in a statement that manipulation of social media by terrorist organizations and foreign governments is "one of the greatest challenges to American democracy" and he wants to make sure the companies are doing everything possible to combat it."Clearly, to date, their efforts have been unsuccessful," Graham said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
'I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy,' Sen. Chuck Schumer says in response to Trump tweets:::::The morning after a terrorist killed eight people in lower Manhattan, President Donald Trump pointed the finger at Sen. Chuck Schumer for a program that let the suspect into the country.At 7:24 a.m. EDT, Trump tweeted that "the terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty."Schumer responded an hour later, tweeting "I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy."Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who rebuked Trump last week, came to New York Democrat's defense.Flake said Schumer did away with the program Trump accused Schumer of putting in place, tweeting "I know, I was there."Trump also tweeted that his administration is "fighting hard for Merit Based immigration."The terror suspect, Sayfullah Habibullaehevic Saipov, is a 29-year-old Uzbek national who entered the United States in 2010, according to NBC News.Authorities say he drove a rented truck that mowed down bikers and pedestrians along the West Side Highway on Tuesday afternoon, killing eight people in the city's deadliest terror attack since 9/11.After exiting the truck while carrying paintball and pellet guns, he was shot and wounded by police and taken into custody.A note found inside the truck translates to "ISIS Lives Forever," a senior official told NBC.Correction: This story was revised to correct the time of the Trump tweet.It was 7:24 a.m. EDT.
Republican voters’ loyalty to Trump shows that the GOP has become an 'anti-idea' party:::::Ex-Sen. Tom Coburn has offered a theory for why so many Republicans still back President Donald Trump despite behavior that has alienated so many others."We have a leader who has a personality disorder," the Oklahoma Republican told The New York Times last week, but "he's done what he actually told the people he was going to do and they're not going to abandon him."The first assertion offered a damning description of the president.But the second, in a different way, damns his party.That's because Trump's aides and allies in Congress have spent much of this year trying to keep him from doing things he said he'd do in last year's campaign which, in turn, shows how Republican politics have drifted from governing realities in 21st century America.The delay in the tax bill Trump and GOP leaders had hoped to release on Wednesday provides an example.Candidate Trump initially proposed a cut so massive it would have taken millions more Americans off the tax rolls, cut the top personal rate to 25 percent and cut the top corporate rate to 15 percent.Trump claimed it would produce such an explosion of growth that the deficit wouldn't grow at all.But the conservative Tax Foundation forecast $10 trillion in higher deficits, and the plan has been whittled down since.Congressional Republicans acknowledge the scaled-back version with a top corporate rate of 20 percent and top personal rate of at least 35 percent will increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion.Red ink would rise even more unless the plan includes offsetting provisions to raise revenue.But Trump has opposed some prominent options.And the resulting difficulty in making the plan add up contributed to the delay.The same problem hobbled the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.Trump pledged better, cheaper health care for all Americans without touching Medicaid a standard that Republican plans could not meet.On other issues, advisers have kept Trump from labeling China a "currency manipulator" and imposing retribution on American companies that move factories offshore.
Donald Trump will not visit the DMZ on South Korean border:::::U.S. President Donald Trump will not go to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) on the border of North Korea and South Korea during his Asia trip, a senior administration official said on Tuesday."The president is not going to visit the DMZ.There is not enough time in the schedule," the official told reporters in a background briefing.Instead, Trump will be the first American president to visit Camp Humphreys, a military installation south of the South Korean capital of Seoul."We thought that would make more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there," the official said.U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula last week and Vice President Mike Pence made the same trip in April.The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity in briefing reporters, noted the two Trump administration forays to the zone."It's becoming a little bit of a cliche, frankly," the official said.Trump leaves for his first trip to Asia this week and is expected to arrive on November 5 in Tokyo.Separately, two U.S. officials said a decision may be made for the three aircraft carriers currently in the Asia Pacific region to carry out an exercise to coincide with Trump's trip.The officials said no decision had been made, but it would be the first exercise with three U.S. aircraft carriers in the region since 2007.A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the buildup of naval forces was part of the military component of the Trump administration's strategy to put "maximum pressure" on North Korea, which includes sanctions and diplomatic isolation.Earlier on Tuesday, the State Department welcomed a decision by China and South Korea to resume normal ties after a year-long standoff over a decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy a missile defense system to counter North Korea's nuclear program.Correction: This article has been updated to reflect when Trump is expected to arrive in Tokyo.
The US is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea despite Trump rejection:::::While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue "diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops," the official's comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless.There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans.Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump's comments, North Korea's weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun's interactions with North Koreans had been reined in."It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance," said the senior State Department official.Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to "stop testing" nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland.The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of "maximum pressure and engagement" that has so far failed to deter North Korea.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat.Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to "totally destroy" North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of military conflict.Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was "wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man" - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader.Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican's first presidential trip to Asia.'Broader mandate' for diplomacy At the start of Trump's presidency, Yun's instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners."It is (now) a broader mandate than that," said the official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea's nuclear and missile program.The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States.The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the official said.The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.Warmbier's death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang's stepped-up testing, the official said.The official said, however, that "the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement" and suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were "misleading."Diplomacy, the official said, "has a lot more room to go."But Trump's threats against North Korea are believed to have complicated diplomatic efforts.
Facebook pledges to double its 10,000-person safety and security staff by end of 2018:::::Facebook, under intensifying pressure from legislators and consumers to clean up its site, is pledging to double the number of people it has working on issues related to safety and security.Colin Stretch, a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, testified before senators on Tuesday alongside executives from Twitter and Google.He told them that Facebook's staff focused on sensitive security and community issues will grow to 20,000 by the end of next year."Today, across our safety, security, and product and community operation teams, we have about 10,000 people who are working on safety and security generally," Stretch said during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing related to Russian interference in the 2016 election."We're committed to investing more and doubling that number by the end of 2018."That's an enormous personnel commitment for Facebook.As of June 30, the company had a total of 20,658 employees.The groups that specifically focus on terrorist content include thousands of workers broadly and 150 who spend all their time removing terrorism-related content, Stretch said.In 2016, Facebook's total headcount grew from 12,691 employees to 17,048.Facebook has already said that it would hire 3,000 content moderators to review and take down videos of violence and suicide attempts.The company also previously said it would hire 1,000 more people to review and take down ads.This additional 10,000 is inclusive of the 4,000 already planned.The company said some of the new hires will be contractors.The testimony comes just ahead of Facebook's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, and amid a series of congressional hearings on the role of advertising companies in the election.Facebook has told investors for some time that it would continue to invest in staffing, despite slowing revenue growth.In its last annual report, Facebook said rising costs were largely the result of increased hiring in research and development and sales and marketing.Facebook shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $180.06 on Tuesday.With reporting by CNBC's Julia Boorstin
House GOP delays releasing tax-reform bill until Thursday:::::House Republicans, in consultation with President Donald Trump, postponed the release of their tax bill by one day until Thursday."We just had a few finishing touches to do," House Budget Chairwoman Diane Black told CNBC."We wanted to make sure we had this right when we put it out."The complexity of providing working Americans and corporations with tax cuts, while at the same time overhauling and simplifying the U.S. tax code is "almost like a puzzle," Black said on "Squawk Box.""Of course there will be winners and losers," but when lawmakers see the whole bill "it will be something most people will like," the Tennessee Republican said.Black is also a member on Ways and Means, which is taking the lead on crafting the legislation.She acts as a liaison between the two committees.House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, issued this statement Tuesday night confirming earlier reports about the delay.Ways and Means Committee Members met tonight to discuss the work we are doing on pro-growth tax reform.In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday.We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week.A short time later, Trump tweeted encouragement.A compromise was under discussion on one of the sticking points allow taxpayers from high-tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California, to continue to deduct property taxes from their federal tax bills, according to NBC News.But the provision that allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal tax returns would be eliminated.Black explained why this particular issue is so divisive."Our taxes, particularly in Tennessee are low, but we're subsidizing places like New York and California," she said."They have their governors continuing to raise their taxes and then just write it off because they can write it off in the federal government."That's not fair, she added.A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that just 25 percent call the Trump tax plan a good idea, while 35 percent call it a bad idea and the rest had no opinion.Black said the tax bill will be released at 9 a.m. EDT Thursday.
In the wake of NYC terrorist attack, Trump says he's ordered increased 'Extreme Vetting':::::President Donald Trump has requested for a heightened vetting program following Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York.Trump signed an executive order in January that imposed tighter screening on foreigners entering the U.S., known as extreme vetting.At the time, he called the measure a safeguard against terrorism.Recently, he attempted to enforce an open-ended ban on citizens from eight countries, including Iran, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.Many of the president's actions regarding travel and immigration including three attempts to ban travelers from certain countries have been met with legal resistance and unfavorable court rulings.His remarks on Tuesday came after a motorist struck several people earlier in the day, leaving at least eight people dead and a dozen injured.NBC News reported the attacker's name is Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an Uzbek national who entered the U.S. in 2010.After being shot in the abdomen by a police officer, the suspect was taken to a hospital, where he refused to answer an initial round of questions, according to NBC News.Tuesday's incident was done for ISIS, according to a note law enforcement officials found, WNBC reported.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist attack.New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo said there's no evidence to suggest there's a wider threat or plot, warning that people will still see more security forces out of caution.In a separate tweet, the president referred to the suspect as a "sick and deranged person."Later, the president also expressed his condolences for the victims and their families.First lady Melania Trump tweeted, "My heart breaks for #NYC today.Thoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation."In an official statement released by the White House, Trump said his administration "will provide its full support to the New York City Police Department," including a joint investigation with the FBI, for the "cowardly attack."CNBC's Angelica Lavito contributed to this report.
Trump tax plan has lackluster public support, poll says:::::President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans begin their drive to cut taxes with lackluster public support, according to the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey shows that just 25 percent call the Trump tax plan a good idea, while 35 percent call it a bad idea.The remaining 40 percent say they have no opinion."For what is a major legislative objective of the president and his party, tax reform is in very mushy shape," said Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who helps produce the NBC/WSJ poll.McInturff's Democratic counterpart Peter Hart said: "There are a lot of things the Trump administration will have to communicate to get this done."Among them is the most basic message of all: that the GOP plan will actually cut Americans' taxes.As the debate gets underway, the poll shows, just 14 percent of Americans believe they'll get a tax cut, while 25 percent expect their taxes to go up.Similarly, just 19 percent of Americans say the tax legislation will significantly improve the economy.At the same time, 35 percent expect it will substantially increase the budget deficit.The proposal starts with the least favorable public opinion landscape of any major legislative initiative since President George W. Bush's attempt to partially privatize the Social Security system in December 2004.President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act both debuted with greater public support.Concluded McInturff, the GOP pollster: "Trump and Republicans have a long way to go."
Time to shop for Obamacare: What you need to know this enrollment season:::::Sign-ups for Obamacare individual plans that take effect Jan. 1 begin Wednesday on HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange that serves most of the country, and on the 12 exchanges that serve the remaining 11 individual states and the District of Columbia.A large percentage of Americans are unaware of the open enrollment start date, surveys have shown.Open enrollment this season on HealthCare.gov states ends Dec. 15 weeks or even months earlier than Obamacare's previous sign-up seasons.However, nine states that operate their own exchanges have set enrollment deadlines after HealthCare.gov's deadline, according to Charles Gaba, who runs the Obamacare tracking site ACASignups.net.Among the latest are California and New York, which have Jan. 31 deadlines.If you haven't chosen an Obamacare plan by your state's deadline, you won't be able to do so until next fall, unless you qualify for a special enrollment period.And people who lack coverage during the year face a penalty of the higher of 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult.Lori Lodes, who oversaw Obamacare outreach efforts in the Obama administration, said that her message during past enrollment seasons and this one is the same for people who have an individual plan or who lack coverage: "Visit HealthCare.gov and shop."HealthCare.gov will direct people to their proper state exchanges if the federal site doesn't serve their states, she noted.Lodes said many people "think health coverage is out of reach, it's just too expensive."But in reality, "coverage might be more affordable than you think," said Lodes, co-founder of Get America Covered, an Obamacare advocacy group started this year to counteract the Trump administration's negative messaging about the ACA.Get America Covered has put together its own primer on open enrollment, which can be seen here.Many people qualify for federal subsidies, or tax credits, that can significantly reduce their premiums for Obamacare plans.More than 80 percent of HealthCare.gov customer get subsidies that lower their premiums.The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, in a report Monday, said that 80 percent of HealthCare.gov customers would be able to find a plan for $75 per month or less, because of their subsidies.That's up from about 70 percent of customers in prior years.In 2018, individuals who earn between about $12,000 and $48,240 annually qualify for such subsidies.For a four-person family, subsidies are available if the household earns between $24,600 and $98,400.Gaba, of ACASignups.net, said people should carefully check their eligibility for premiums on HealthCare.gov.He noted that income thresholds, which are linked to the official federal poverty level, rise every year."There are going to be a lot of people this year who may not have qualified for tax credits in 2017 who may be qualified this [next] year," Gaba said.Premiums for many Obamacare plans that take effect in 2018 rose sharply.The prices of the most popular types of plans, known as silver plans, rose by an average of more than 30 percent.Much of the increase in prices was due to threats by the Trump administration to stop paying insurers reimbursements for discounts to out-of-pocket costs the insurers must offer low-income Obamacare customers.The administration followed through on those threats in mid-October.Customers who don't qualify for subsidies will be hit with the higher prices, in many cases.However, the price hikes have created an unusual situation for subsidized customers and some nonsubsidized customers, one in which they will actually pay less for their insurance plans in 2018 than they did in 2017.Subsidized customers are generally insulated either totally or mostly from the price hikes because their subsidies rise in value as the premiums increase.And nonsubsidized customers may be able to find less expensive coverage than silver plans by opting for either bronze or gold plans.The Kaiser Family Foundation in an analysis released this week said more people will find plans at zero cost to themselves in 2018 than in prior years, because of the higher subsidies.Kev Coleman, head of research at the insurance comparison site HealthPocket, said that he tells friends, family and other people looking for Obamacare enrollment advice "not to limit themselves to just one source of shopping."Coleman said that in addition to checking out HealthCare.gov or their state-run marketplace, customers should check out plans sold directly by insurance companies, brokers and internet-based insurance brokerages."Each one can have very distinct inventories" of individual health plans, Coleman said."You have to look at all available options."However, subsidies for Obamacare plans are only available to customers who buy a plan sold on the government-run exchanges, or through a web-based broker who sells such plans."Don't just shop on price alone," Coleman warned.While bronze plans tend to be the lowest priced, they also have relatively high out-of-pocket costs when customers go to the doctor, get surgery or buy prescription drugs.And plans might impose higher costs, or offer no coverage at all, for certain brands of drugs."People think 'all drugs are covered,'" Coleman noted."No."Another issue to consider, he said, is the size and design of a health insurance plan's network: the doctors, hospitals and other providers that are covered by the plan.If a person has insurance, but ends up getting services from an out-of-network provider, the cost can be steep, or even onerous.
Rep. Jeb Hensarling will not run for re-election in 2018:::::House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling will not run for re-election in 2018 20 Hours Ago | 01:41 Rep. Jeb Hensarling announced Tuesday that he will not seek re-election in 2018.Hensarling said in a statement that he decided to time his retirement from Congress with the end of his term as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.The 60-year-old Republican from Texas also said he wanted to spend more time with his family.First elected to Congress in 2002, Hensarling said, "I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned."The congressman said there is still plenty left on the agenda at the House Financial Services Committee, such as housing finance reform and deregulation.Hensarling has been a proponent of rolling back Dodd-Frank, the reform package designed to limit the high-risk practices that triggered the financial crisis.The House passed a bill in June that would gut many of the key elements of those banking reforms.For the remainder of his term, Hensarling said, he looks forward to working with the rest of Congress on overhauling the tax code.GOP lawmakers are expected to unveil their draft of a tax reform bill this week.Hensarling is the latest Republican lawmaker to announce his retirement from Congress.Last week, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake also said he would not seek re-election next year in a sharp rebuke to a Republican Party that he said has given into a "more viscerally satisfied anger and resentment" under President Donald Trump.But unlike Flake, Hensarling was not in danger of losing his seat.In the 2016 election, the Texas Republican won his House seat handily, with about 81 percent of the vote in his district.That margin is far greater than the 50 percent of ballots cast that won Flake his Senate seat.In September, Republican Sen. Bob Corker said he would not be running for re-election in 2018.The president subsequently taunted the Tennessee senator, who responded by saying, "It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center."This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.
Trump says he wants House to pass tax reform by Thanksgiving:::::Trump: Want the House to pass tax bill by Thanksgiving 22 Hours Ago | 00:23 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he hopes tax reform can be accomplished by year-end."I want the House to pass a bill by Thanksgiving.I want all of the people standing by my side when we get ready to sign by Christmas hopefully before Christmas," he said at a hastily scheduled press availability.When asked if he was looking into phasing in corporate tax rate reductions, Trump responded, "We're not looking for that, hopefully not."The president made his remarks after meeting with business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable.House Republicans are expected to release a draft their long-anticipated tax bill Wednesday.Trump is scheduled to depart for a trip to several countries in Asia on Friday.While the president is overseas, some White House officials will stay behind to work on the tax overhaul effort, including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and top economic advisor Gary Cohn.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
White House releases official portraits of Trump, Pence:::::The White House on Tuesday released the first official portraits of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, more than nine months after Trump took office in January.Thousands of copies of the portraits will be printed by the Government Publishing Office and distributed to post offices, federal agencies and other government buildings.Tuesday's release ended months on speculation over why Trump's portrait had not replaced that of former President Barack Obama in federal office buildings, where portraits of the sitting president and vice president are often prominently displayed.
Investigations of Manafort in New York Are Beyond Trump’s Power to Pardon:::::Mueller is now untouchable after the Manafort indictment: Former US attorney 8:40 AM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 05:44 The two New York prosecutors, both Democrats, have issued subpoenas and sought financial records about Mr. Manafort's real estate and business activities in New York, according to three people briefed on the investigations who were not authorized to discuss law enforcement matters that were continuing.Possible violations being pursued by Mr. Vance could carry prison sentences of up to four years for Mr. Manafort, who has denied any wrongdoing.The two New York prosecutors, both Democrats, have issued subpoenas and sought financial records about Mr. Manafort's real estate and business activities in New York, according to three people briefed on the investigations who were not authorized to discuss law enforcement matters that were continuing.Possible violations being pursued by Mr. Vance could carry prison sentences of up to four years for Mr. Manafort, who has denied any wrongdoing.Neither of the prosecutors has determined whether any state charges are warranted, and if they did, those cases would most likely advance only in the event of a presidential pardon.Asked about the possibility of a pardon for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: "I haven't had any conversations with him about that.I think we should let the process play through before we start looking at those steps."The New York investigations focus in part on Mr. Manafort's relationship with the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, a small lender that provided him some big loans.The bank, which received a subpoena but is not itself under investigation, is led by Stephen M. Calk, a onetime economic adviser to Mr. Trump.Mr. Vance's office is questioning whether Mr. Manafort misled the bank when applying for the loans, the people briefed on the investigation said, a previously unreported development that hews closely to the federal indictment announced on Monday.In examining the loan documents, Mr. Vance's office is seeking to determine whether Mr. Manafort used the loan money for an unauthorized purpose, which could amount to filing a false business record, a crime in New York State.The New York prosecutors are also seeking to trace cash that Mr. Manafort moved in and out of American bank accounts, partly to verify whether he paid state taxes on income earned overseas, the people said.Investigators working for the New York prosecutors have obtained documents suggesting that at least some of the money came from a bank in Cyprus, the Mediterranean nation considered a tax haven and a magnet for Russian money.This is another area of inquiry that overlaps with Mr. Mueller's case, a 12-count indictment that accused Mr. Manafort and a business partner of conspiracy to launder money from accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere.The overlap will most likely mean that Mr. Mueller's case will take priority over Mr. Vance's and Mr. Schneiderman's.And while Mr. Vance's office is continuing to investigate Mr. Manafort, Mr. Schneiderman has deferred his inquiry into the former Trump campaign chairman, at least temporarily, so as to not interfere with the federal case, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.Mr. Schneiderman would most likely resume his investigation if Mr. Manafort received a presidential pardon, the person said.This year, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported the existence of Mr. Vance's investigation and his subpoena of the Chicago bank, while The New York Times and others have reported Mr. Manafort's extensive financial ties to Cyprus and Mr. Calk's relationship with the Trump campaign.The status of Mr. Schneiderman's investigation, and the focus of Mr. Vance's, were not previously known.A spokeswoman for Mr. Vance declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman.Mr. Schneiderman has clashed with Mr. Trump or his associates on a number of occasions.He sued the Trump administration to preserve an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, and he sued Trump University, contending that it used high-pressure sales tactics and false claims to woo students.Mr. Trump settled the case after winning the election.
Connecticut AG on generic drug price-fixing suit: 'This is just the tip of the iceberg':::::Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen, who is leading a coalition of states suing generic drugmakers, told CNBC on Tuesday that the industry is rife with collusion."We've uncovered through emails, text messages and telephone patterns, plus cooperating witnesses, a very compelling case of systematic and pervasive price fixing within the industry," Jepson said in a "Power Lunch" interview.On Tuesday, 45 states, including Connecticut, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico moved to expand their lawsuit to 18 companies and 15 medicines.The suit also names two individual executives, including Rajiv Malik, president Pennsylvania-based Mylan.Shares of Mylan were down about 8 percent after news broke of allegations against Malik.Bernstein senior analyst Ronny Gal said the stock's drop was justified."It's a relatively small industry where people move from company to company, and generally know each other," Gal said on "Power Lunch.""When people are trying to make their numbers, and they are sitting in the same location, yeah, once in a while a conversation crosses over the line."Gal clarified that he had not personally witnessed an incriminating conversation, but that he could "completely see how something like this could happen."In a statement, Mylan said it found no evidence of price fixing by the company or any of its employees, and vowed to defend itself vigorously."Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its president, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully," the company's statement said.As for how much the alleged collusion cost consumers, Jepson couldn't be specific.But he did emphasize that in an industry valued at about $75 billion, where 88 percent of prescriptions are written for generic drugs, the cost was likely massive.Since there is evidence the collusion stretches back about a decade, Jepson said he's confident more players are involved."We are uncovering new information almost every day," he added."I can't stress enough this is just the tip of the iceberg."The original complaint, filed in December, had focused on six companies and two medicines.Reuters contributed to this report.
John Kelly: 'The lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War':::::White House Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday said, "the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War."Speaking to Fox News, Kelly offered a view of history in which both sides of the Civil War a pro-slavery Confederacy and the opposing Union were made up of "men and women of good faith."Kelly's views echoed those of his boss, President Donald Trump, who claimed that "both sides" were to blame after violence broke out during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that claimed the life of an anti-racism protester."There are certain things in history that were not so good, and other things that were very, very good," Kelly said."I think we make a mistake as a society, and certainly as individuals, when we take what is accepted as right and wrong, and go back 100, 200, 300 years or more and say, 'What Christopher Columbus did was wrong.'""Five hundred years later, it's inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then.I just think it's very very dangerous.It shows you how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is," said Kelly, a retired Marine Corps General.Kelly then explained his view of the Civil War: "[Confederate General] Robert E. Lee was an honorable man who gave up his country to fight for his state," Kelly said."One hundred and fifty years ago, that was more important than country it was always loyalty to state back in those days.Now it's different.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand."Kelly did not elaborate about what compromise would have prevented a war fought over the future of slavery in the United States.Southern U.S. states began seceding from the Union in December 1860, following the election one month earlier of President Abraham Lincoln, whose Republican Party had strong anti-slavery sentiments.The economy of the mostly agricultural South was at that time dependent on massive-scale, slave labor.CNBC reached out to the White House late Monday to clarify what compromises Kelly believes were lacking in the lead-up to to the Civil War, and will update this post with any response.
Donald Trump in South Korea:::::The U.S.-South Korea relationship has been on shaky footing as both nations espouse different views on reigning in a belligerent Pyongyang.At a time of heightened alarm on the Korean Peninsula, President Donald Trump has a chance to strengthen the 67 year-old military alliance when he visits Seoul in a week.His trip will be especially vital in rectifying the sense of exclusion felt by both officials and civilians in Asia's fourth-largest economy.Many South Koreans feel their country has been sidelined during the North Korea crisis an idea that domestic media has dubbed "Korean passing."News outlets regularly point out how Trump's engagement with Seoul on the issue pales in comparison to his relationship with Tokyo, reflected by the frequency and intensity of phone conversations with leaders of both countries.
Facebook says Russia-backed election content reached 126 million Americans:::::Facebook said on Monday that Russia-based operatives published about 80,000 posts on the social network over a two year period in an effort to sway U.S. politics, and that about 126 million Americans may have seen the posts during that time.Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony the company provided to U.S. lawmakers which was seen by Reuters.Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet's Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia's Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to 1 out of 23,000 posts.The posts though violated Facebook's terms of service and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote."These actions run counter to Facebook's mission of building community and everything we stand for.And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat," he wrote.The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017 and most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.
Obamacare will cost less for many people this year — but fewer likely to buy it:::::More people can get an Obamacare plan for free in 2018 or for less than they paid for it this year but fewer people are expected to buy Obamacare plans next year.That head-scratching scenario came into focus Monday with three analyses released in advance of Wednesday's start of open enrollment in Obamacare health insurance.The first, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that "in many case, lower-income consumers" who get federal subsidies that reduce their Obamacare premiums "will pay less for premiums in 2018 than in 2017."The other two reports estimated that Obamacare enrollment will drop by anywhere from 800,000 to 1.6 million customers this sign-up season than had enrolled by the close of open enrollment for 2017.Kaiser's analysis, which found better deals for many customers in 2018, may seem counterintuitive because Obamacare prices are, as a rule, rising sharply next year.And the biggest price increases are being seen among so-called silver plans, which are purchased by more than 70 percent of Obamacare customers.The U.S. Health and Human Services Department on Monday said the average price of a "benchmark" Obamacare plan for a 27-year-old is rising by 37 percent in 2018.But most Obamacare customers qualify for federal tax credits that let them buy plans at a discount often a steep discount.And because the value of those tax credits rise with the price of the benchmark plan which is the second-lowest-cost silver plan in their geographic region many customers will be getting bigger subsidies this year than they have in the past.Those bigger subsidies will in many cases allow subsidized customers to find plans that will cost them less than what they pay now or even free plans.Kaiser on Monday published an interactive map illustrating that fact.A 40-year-old Obamacare customer with an income of $25,000 or less could, in huge swathes of the United States, find a "bronze" Obamacare plan whose cost is fully covered by the tax credit that person receives.In other words, the customer would personally have to pay nothing for their bronze plan.Bronze plans, as a rule, have lower retail prices than silver plans, and have higher out-of-pocket costs when customers use health services or buy prescription drugs.Kaiser also published another map showing how subsidy-eligible customers in large parts of United States can find "gold plans" that are either less expensive than silver plans, or less than $100 per month more expensive than silver plans.Gold plans as a rule have higher retail prices than silver plans but cover more of their customers' health costs.A gold plan that costs less than a silver plan for a subsidized customer would offer that customer a way to avoid the premium hikes that nonsubsidized customers are getting hit with this year.And for a subsidized customer with higher health needs, a gold plan that costs marginally more in premiums could make more financial sense than signing up for a silver plan with higher out-of-pocket health costs.Kaiser's report on the premium changes said that "the peculiar effect" those changes have on plans for subsidized and unsubsidized customers "makes it important that customers shop around and carefully consider their options."But Obamacare experts believe that a significant number of Obamacare customers, potential and current, will not bother to sign up, much less shop around for a better deal.In its analysis Monday, Standard & Poor's Global Ratings estimated that only 10.6 million to 11.4 million people would sign up for Obamacare plans during open enrollment this season.That would represent a drop-off of about 7 percent to 13 percent from the 12.2 million who enrolled for this year's sign-up season.S&P said there will be decreases in sign-ups among nonsubsidized Obamacare customers in the face of higher premiums.S&P also said there will be a drop in the number of new enrollees.And finally, there will be fewer sign-ups because the Trump administration is scaling back the budget for outreach to encourage enrollment, the firm said."Insurance remains a product that is sold rather than bought, and this is especially the case when trying to gain wider acceptance for health insurance among individuals who consider themselves young and invincible," S&P said in its report.In a separate report, the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, estimated that 1 million fewer people would enroll in Obamacare plans this year.CAP's report said that 12.2 million people the same number as 2017 would have likely signed up for 2018 plans "in the absences of ACA sabotage" by the Trump administration."The Trump administration's repeated actions to destabilize insurance markets, repeal the ACA, and undermine open enrollment threaten this progress and seem likely to depress enrollment in 2018," wrote Emily Gee and Thomas Huelskoetter in CAP's report.
Manafort ordered under house arrest as his lawyer calls charges 'ridiculous':::::A federal judge on Monday ordered former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to be placed under house arrest after Manafort's plea of "not guilty" in response to a 12-count indictment in federal court related to money laundering and foreign lobbying contracts.Manafort's longtime associate Rick Gates was also indicted on identical charges, which stem from special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Calling both defendants a flight risk because of their connections to foreign governments, a federal judge also required that they surrender their passports and that Manafort post a $10 million bond.Gates' bond was set at $5 million.Manafort and Gates stand accused of conspiring to conceal tens of millions of dollars in undisclosed payments for lobbying work they performed on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.The bulk of this lobbying work occurred between 2012 and 2014, two years before Manafort joined the Trump campaign.Following Manafort's appearance Monday in federal court in Washington, his lawyer, Kevin Downing, spoke to reporters outside the courthouse, where he called the charges against his client "ridiculous.""There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government," said Downing, adding that the goal of Manafort's work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine was to "further democracy and help Ukraine come closer to the United States and Europe."Downing said that Manafort would address the charges Tuesday.A spokesman for Gates said earlier that his client looks forward to fighting the charges against him.Manafort and Gates are both due back in court on Thursday, before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson.Here's the statement from Manafort's attorney:
Here's where Mueller says Manafort's money went:::::The payments allegedly included tens of millions of dollars on home improvements, including $934,350 spent at an antique rug store in Alexandria and $623,910 paid to an antique dealer in New York.The list includes alleged payments of $849,215 at a men's clothing store in New York, $520,440 at a clothing store in Beverly Hills, and payments of $163,705 for three Range Rovers, a $62,750 Mercedes Benz and a $47,000 Range Rover.Manafort also allegedly used offshore accounts to buy real estate, including $2.85 million for a New York City condo in Soho and a Brooklyn brownstone that cost $3 million.Separately, court papers were unsealed Monday detailing a guilty plea by George Papadopoulos, a member of the Trump campaign's foreign policy team, on charges of lying to federal agents about his dealings with several Russians who were offering "dirt" on Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.Papadopoulos admitted to lying about the nature of his interactions with "foreign nationals" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials.Trump aides have said he played a limited role in the campaign and had no access to Trump.The guilty plea by Papadopoulos marked the first criminal count that cites interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the campaign.The indictment against Manafort and Gates also alleges that they acted as unregistered agents of the government of Ukraine and a Ukrainian political party whose leader Viktor Yanukovych was president from 2010 to 2014.Other counts against Manafort and Gates included acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine's government, false and misleading statements, and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.The indictment also contains a count of "conspiracy against the United States," but those charges relate to Mueller's allegations that transactions were made from offshore accounts to avoid paying federal taxes.Despite the detailed money laundering allegations, there were no allegations of Russian involvement in the election.After the indictment was unsealed, the president quickly tweeted that the alleged crimes were "years ago," and insisted there was "NO COLLUSION" between his campaign and Russia.He also pointed to his Democratic rival in the election, Clinton, tweeting: "Why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????"As the White House sought to downplay the charges, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted that most of the alleged activities took place before the 2016 campaign."We've been saying from Day One there's no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all," she added."Were it to end here the White House would be very happy, but I think no one thinks it's going to end here," said Robert Driscoll, a former deputy U.S. attorney general.The Associated Press contributed to this article.Correction: The indictment also named Manafort's former deputy, Richard Gates.An earlier version misstated his name.
Here's what the charges against Manafort and Gates mean:::::Manafort indictment has nothing to do with Russia election meddling: Former US prosecutor 3:04 PM ET Mon, 30 Oct 2017 | 06:00 The Department of Justice on Monday unveiled indictments of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former longtime business partner Rick Gates, alleging the pair hid overseas payments and conspired to launder money.The special counsel's team, led by Robert Mueller, laid out the charges in a 31-page indictment: The indictment contains 12 counts: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.Terms such as "conspiracy against the United States" and "unregistered agent of a foreign principal" sound ominous, but, according to a 30-year veteran of corporate litigation, it is important that people shouldn't read too much into the wording."All federal charges are written to sound serious," Ira Matetsky, lawyer and partner at Manhattan-based firm Ganfer & Shore, told CNBC.Matetsky stressed the importance of understanding the charges' context.However, he believes the charges in this case are very serious, as they include felony accusations.The indictments mark a new phase in Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.But, while Manafort was once President Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Matetsky sees the connection to the White House ending there, at least for now."This is activity that happened to come up while investigating someone who was on Mueller's radar," Matetsky said.Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who has written about white collar crime for The New York Times, agrees with Matetsky."Anything related to the election is tangential" at this point, Henning told CNBC, as the accusations revealed Monday are "a couple steps removed at best.""Everyone thinks 'Manafort, Trump,' but I don't see anything at all related to Trump," he said.The case centers around the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Henning said.According to him, Mueller is looking at the work Manafort and Gates did on behalf the Ukrainian government, both for former President Viktor Yanukovych and others."Money laundering is the sexy count, but it's not at the heart of this," Henning said.Mueller is seeking multiple ways to find information for his investigation, both lawyers said.Shortly after unveiling the charges Monday, Mueller revealed a plea deal made with George Papadopoulos, another former advisor to Trump's campaign.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to lying to FBI agents about when he met with Russian nationals to get "dirt" on Hillary Clinton."A takeaway from Papadopoulos being targeted, in addition to Manafort and Gates, might be that this seems to be a wide-ranging investigation rather than a narrowly focused one," Matetsky said.Henning said the details in the indictment of Manafort and Gates also points to Mueller casting a wide net.The special counsel's office has "thrown a lot out there that's not directly relevant to the charges that they're bringing," Henning said."They're liars, is what the special counsel is trying to say here."Beyond involvement in Ukraine, Henning said Mueller will try to pin both men on tax evasion."They are going to try to keep Manafort and Gates from saying 'this was just a few times,'" Henning said.The conspiracy charge is the bow that ties all the more specific charges together, Matetsky said.He defined conspiracy as "when any two people enter into an agreement to break federal law," clarifying that a variety of different crimes may fall under conspiracy, from the money laundering alleged here to tax evasion or even treason.
There are plenty of things that might be in this tax bill that could give the market indigestion:::::The much anticipated tax bill should be bullish for stocks, but strategists say some elements of the legislation the House is going to introduce Wednesday could instead give markets pause.Stocks, already lower on the day, fell further Monday, after a news report said the proposed corporate tax rate of 20 percent would be phased in over five years.While the bill will be far from its anticipated final version, markets could react to any surprises."I think that final bill will not be as grand as Donald Trump envisions.It's not going to be as bold.The reason is they're going to phase in aspects of it," said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investment.Strategists say there are some big positives expected, like 100 percent deduction of capital expenditures.But the market has been anticipating a big bump in corporate earnings with a 20 percent tax rate that would kick in next year, or even this year.The report about the phase in first appeared from Bloomberg News."I think the market doesn't do deep dives when they see news like this," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group."What the mentality is here is every Joe Shmoe on Wall Street did their earnings estimates for next year with a 20 percent tax rate."Stocks recovered some of their initial losses on the report, and the Dow was down about 80 points in afternoon trading after being down more than 100 points.Bond yields also fell on the report, with the 10-year yield touching 2.37.Yields move opposite price."If tax reform is phased in, then the economic upside will be phased out," said Ian Lyngen, rate strategist at BMO."This is the first real week where we're getting down to brass tacks.The first move is to take the teeth out of tax reform."Here are three things analysts say the market could respond to when the bill in introduced.401K deduction - There is a proposal to limit this popular deduction that currently allows workers under 50 to save up to $18,000 in this tax retirement account, while older workers can save more.Analysts say this could be perceived as a negative since it would mean less money automatically going into the market with retirement savings.- There is a proposal to limit this popular deduction that currently allows workers under 50 to save up to $18,000 in this tax retirement account, while older workers can save more.Analysts say this could be perceived as a negative since it would mean less money automatically going into the market with retirement savings.Deduction of interest - There is a proposal to limit the amount of interest a corporation could deduct.This could impact some high debt companies.- There is a proposal to limit the amount of interest a corporation could deduct.This could impact some high debt companies.State and local taxes - This deduction, important in high tax states like New Jeresy, New York and California, is proposed to be dropped.Valliere believes there will be a compromise on it to limit the deduction for high income individuals rather than eliminate it across the board.Keefe Bruyette and Woods analysts said Wednesday's bill will be a "starting rather than an ending point."They also noted that they do not believe the 20 percent tax rate will hold, and they and other analysts say it will have to move higher as Congress removes deductions.Analysts say tax writers are struggling to find a way to change the law to allow small businesses to pay the corporate, not individual tax rates, without opening the door for others who might use the bill opportunistically to pay less taxes."They want to figure out how to stop individuals from gaming the system," said Valliere.
Trump’s refrain of ‘nothing to see here’ rings hollow after first 3 Mueller charges land:::::For President Donald Trump the fake news just got very real and dangerous.By charging three Trump 2016 campaign operatives with crimes, special counsel Robert Mueller just took the Trump-Russia investigation from the realm of speculation and debate and moved it into sworn testimony and court proceedings.One has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators; the other two, former campaign chief Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, now have an enormous incentive to cooperate in a bid for leniency.Trump reacted on Twitter by noting that the tax fraud charges against Manafort stem from events "years ago before he joined the Trump campaign."The president reiterated his frequent claim that there was "NO COLLUSION" with Russia in the 2016 campaign.But the third defendant Mueller named Monday renders that claim increasingly tinny.
Obamacare prices: Trump administration touts bad news on cost, buries good news about affordability:::::The Trump administration on Monday highlighted Obamacare's increasing prices and shrinking insurer choices as proof the health-care law has "failed" but buried the fact that more people than ever can get a health plan for less than $75 per month.The administration also did not mention evidence that its own policies have helped drive Obamacare premiums higher next year than they otherwise would be.At the same time, a new survey shows widespread ignorance of the fact that Wednesday is the start of open enrollment in Obamacare insurance plans.Almost 76 percent of people do not know that date, according to the poll by Policygenius.And more than 18 percent believe the Affordable Care Act is not longer the law of the law."These results aren't particularly surprising," said Policygenius CEO Jennifer Fitzgerald."There's been a hostility from the Trump administration toward the ACA."That hostility has included trying to repeal the law, deeply cutting Obamacare's advertising budget and shortening the enrollment period for individual health plans to just six weeks.Another sign of that hostility came Monday, as the U.S. Health and Human Services Department the agency responsible for overseeing Obamacare blasted the law as it released a report on health plan choices and premiums for 2018."This data demonstrates just how rapidly Obamacare's exchanges are deteriorating with skyrocketing premiums year after year, more than half of Americans with no more than two insurers to choose from, and the taxpayer burden exploding," said HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley."There is an urgent and serious need to repeal this failed law and replace it with patient-centered solutions," Oakley said.The report highlighted price increases facing customers who do not receive federal subsidies that limit their monthly premium payments for Obamacare plans.In the past, under the Obama administration, HHS had highlighted the effect of that financial aid, and underscored how many people qualify for it.About 85 percent of people who buy plans on government-run Obamacare exchanges such as HealthCare.gov receive those subsidies.However, no one who buys coverage outside of those marketplaces gets that financial help, meaning they will bear the full brunt of the price hikes.HHS said the average monthly premium for so-called benchmark plans sold on HealthCare.gov purchased by a 27-year-old are increasing 37 percent in 2018 over what they cost this year.That contrasts with a 24 percent increase in benchmark plan prices seen in 2017 on HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange that serves most of the nation.HHS said the average annual premium for a nonsubsidized 27-year-old in a benchmark plan will be $4,932, "up from $2,616 during Obamacare's first year."Benchmark plans, whose prices affect subsidy levels, are the second-lowest priced "silver" Obamacare plan in a geographic region.More than 70 percent of Obamacare customers buy silver plans.The HHS report did not refer to data that show that a significant fraction of the premium price hikes seen for 2018 are due to concerns by insurers that the Trump administration would cut off key reimbursement payments to those insurers.A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released last week found that insurers added surcharges of anywhere from 7 to 38 percent onto their premiums for Obamacare plans because of those threats, which the administration finally executed earlier this month.The HHS report on Monday also noted that 29 percent of customers in HealthCare.gov states will have just one insurer offering Obamacare plans to them on that exchange.That compares with 20 percent of customers last year, and just 2 percent of customers in 2016.Eight entire states will have just one insurer offering Obamacare plans in 2018.More than half of HealthCare.gov customers 55 percent will have plans from two or fewer insurers to choose from in 2018.That compares with 43 percent in 2016, and 14 percent in 2015, accoding to HHS.Lori Lodes, a former top Obama admnistration health official now involved in an Obamacare advocacy group, Get America Covered, said HHS had buried some good news for customers in its 40-page report.Lodes was referring to the fact that there has been an increase in the number of HealthCare.gov customers who will be able to buy a plan that will directly cost them $75 or less per month, after their subsidies are factored in."More people than ever can find plans for less than $75/month," Lodes said in an email."In fact, it's 80 percent [of customers], compared to about 70 percent during the previous four open enrollments."She noted that the 80 percent figure appeared on page 37 of the report, and was not referenced on the first page, which had "key findings" highlighted by HHS.Lodes said she was willing to bet that "there's a reason they didn't provide the breakdown" for the percentage of customers in 2018 who will be able to buy a plan for $50 or less per month."Because it too likely has grown a lot," Lodes said.
US court blocks enforcement of Trump's transgender military ban:::::A U.S. federal court in Washington on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing his ban on transgender people serving in the American military.A group of transgender service members last month asked the court to block the planned ban while it considers their claims that it violates their U.S. constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law.U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction halting enforcement of the ban until their case is resolved.
White House: Manafort charges have 'nothing to do with the president':::::She added that Trump had hired Manafort in 2016, "to handle the delegate process" during the Republican National Convention, "and he was dismissed not too long after that."The White House also addressed the guilty plea of George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy advisor on Trump's presidential campaign.Sanders emphasized that Papadopoulos was an unpaid advisor who, she said, only attended one meeting with Trump during the campaign."Any actions he took would have been on his own," Sanders said.Sanders also said that Trump is not currently planning to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller, despite calls from some Republicans that Mueller be fired."There is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel," she said.Manafort's former longtime business partner, Rick Gates, also was charged in the 31-page indictment, made public on Monday.Gates and Manafort both surrendered to authorities on Monday morning.A spokesman for Manafort did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment from CNBC.The indictments mark a new phase in Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.They also cap off a year of escalating legal problems for Manafort and Gates, who worked with Manafort for years on many of his foreign lobbying contracts.
Democrats warn Trump not to impede Mueller's Russia probe:::::Charges against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort emboldened Democrats to call for greater protection for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.While many stopped short of tying Manfort's charges directly to Trump, top Democrats reacted to the developments Monday with concern that the president could impede the investigation or perhaps pardon himself and any of his associates who are in legal jeopardy.An indictment against Manafort and a former business partner Rick Gates, was unsealed Monday.Separately, court filings were unsealed Monday showing that former Trump campaign George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty 3 weeks ago to lying to FBI agents about when he met with Russian nationals to get "dirt" on Hillary Clinton."It is imperative that Congress take action now to protect the independence of the Special Counsel, wherever or however high his investigation may lead," Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement."Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, must also make clear to the President that issuing pardons to any of his associates or to himself would be unacceptable, and result in immediate, bipartisan action by Congress."Warner is the vice chairman of the Senate's Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe into Russian meddling in the election, including potential collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Mueller's probe is essential for U.S. efforts to counteract Russian attempts to interfere with elections."Even with an accelerating Special Counsel investigation inside the Justice Department, and investigations inside the Republican Congress, we still need an outside, fully independent investigation to expose Russia's meddling in our election and the involvement of Trump officials," the former House speaker said."Defending the integrity of our democracy demands that Congress look forward to counter Russian aggression and prevent future meddling with our elections."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said "the investigation must proceed unimpeded."California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating potential Kremlin election meddling, trumpeted the indictments' importance."This is a key development.This is no small fish," he told NPR.
Who is Richard Gates: Paul Manafort's partner in business and indictments:::::Richard Gates has long been the man beside Paul Manafort.That held true Monday when the former business partners surrendered to the FBI as the first to be indicted by the Department of Justice on charges related to foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Gates, 45, served as deputy chair of the Trump campaign and Manafort's right-hand man for day-to-day operations for part of the election cycle.After Manafort left the campaign, Gates remained on as liaison to the Republican National Committee and was later hired by Trump's longtime friend, Tom Barrack, to help with the inauguration, according to New York Magazine.Gates, along with Manafort, was charged with conspiracy against the United States in an indictment unsealed Monday.Gates was also separately charged with failure to disclose accurate information to government agencies.Barrack's Colony NorthStar ended its consulting agreement with Gates on Monday following reports of the indictment, a spokesman confirmed to CNBC.The indictment by the Department of Justice originally filed Friday outlines Gates' ties to a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party.His work with Ukraine ended in 2015, before he started with the Trump campaign.In 2017, Gates retroactively registered some of that service under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, but allegedly falsified information in doing so, according to the indictment.Gates was charged with operating as an agent of Ukraine for at least nine years, ending in 2015, and laundering "tens of millions of dollars in income" during and after that time, according to the indictment.Gates maintained a direct relationship with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the government of Ukraine, at times explicitly purporting to represent the government of Ukraine in Washington, D.C., without properly registering those activities with the U.S. government, the indictment charges.Gates and Manafort continued to "defraud" the U.S. government after the election and into 2017 through money laundering and tax evasion, according to the indictment."Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers," Gates told The New York Times in June."Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately."Before heading up the Trump campaign, Gates and Manafort worked side by side at Manafort's consulting firm, Davis Manafort Partners, according to the indictment.The two men first met more than 30 years earlier when Gates was an intern at a separate consulting firm Black, Manafort, Stone, Kelly according to the Times and New York Magazine.Gates was reportedly not particularly close with, or even well-liked, by Trump.New York Magazine reports Trump often confused Gates with a different "Rick," for example, and yet he maintained ties to the Trump campaign and administration after Manafort was excused.Manafort left the campaign in August 2016 after it was revealed he had accepted payments from Yanukovych.The speculation of influence from Eastern Europe didn't catch up to Manafort's protege until earlier this year, though, when Gates was removed from a post at the pro-Trump advocacy group "America First Policies," New York Magazine reports.A spokesman for Gates could not immediately be located.WATCH: Manafort & Rick Gates indicted
Trump would be 'impeached the next day if he tried to remove Mueller' now, says former federal prosecutor:::::Mueller is now untouchable after the Manafort indictment: Former US attorney 8:40 AM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 05:44 Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has job security after he brought felony charges against President Donald Trump's onetime campaign chairman, a former assistant U.S. attorney told CNBC on Monday."Trump would be impeached the next day if he tried to remove Mueller," said John Lauro, who was a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York from 1986 to 1988 during the presidency of Ronald Reagan."He can't be fired by the president of the United States.There's no way," Lauro told "Squawk on the Street."Paul Manafort, the onetime chairman of the Trump campaign, surrendered to authorities on Monday after he was indicted on 12 counts related to money laundering, including "conspiracy against the United States."A former Manafort colleague, Rick Gates, also has been charged."The significance of the indictment is it gives Mueller cover now going forward," Lauro said."Nobody is going to touch him because Paul Manafort is under indictment.And second, it gives him an opportunity to press Manafort for information."Lauro says U.S. authorities will use the indictment to put pressure on Manafort to "flip" or "cooperate" in the investigation.The government doesn't indict until it has all the information locked down, he added.Trump has dismissed any suggestion that his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.On Monday, Trump responded to the news, and said the alleged crimes by Manafort occurred years before he joined the 2016 campaign.Lauro said people should expect more indictments.A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC on Monday.A spokesman for Gates could not immediately be located.WATCH: How to impeach the President of the United States
Trump Blames Schumer and Immigration Policies Hours After New York Terrorist Attack:::::Photo WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday essentially blamed the terrorist attack in New York City on what he characterized as soft immigration policies promoted by Democrats, singling out Senator Chuck Schumer, the states senior lawmaker and the partys leader in the upper chamber.He made clear that he was getting his information from Fox News, as he often does in the morning.We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems, he wrote.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).@foxandfriends.Mr. Schumer quickly fired back at Mr. Trump in a statement saying that immigration is good for America.President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution antiterrorism funding which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget, Mr. Schumer said in a statement.Im calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding.The diversity visa program cited by Mr. Trump was created in 1990 by a bill supported by Mr. Schumer, passed by bipartisan votes and signed into law by a Republican president, George Bush.Mr. Schumer supported getting rid of the program as part of a comprehensive plan to overhaul the nations immigration laws crafted by eight lawmakers and passed by the Senate in 2013.But the plan was blocked in the House by Republicans who objected to other elements of the plan that they considered too permissive.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona who has broken with Mr. Trump, came to Mr. Schumers defense on Wednesday.Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms, Mr. Flake wrote on Twitter.I know, I was there.Democrats on Wednesday noted that Mr. Trump was quick to assail his political opponents and immigration policies less than 24 hours after the New York attack, even though his own White House declared it unseemly to talk about gun control policies in the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Las Vegas, in which a heavily armed American citizen shot and killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others.This is an unspeakable tragedy.Today is a day for consoling of survivors and mourning those we lost, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said at the time, scolding those who called for more gun control.There is a time and place for political debate, but now is a time to unite as a country.Eight people were killed and 11 were injured when a driver rammed a pickup truck down a bicycle path in Manhattan on Tuesday in what the authorities called the deadliest terrorist attack in the city since Sept. 11, 2001.The driver, who shouted Allahu akbar, was shot by a police officer and was in critical condition on Tuesday night.The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, who came to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan and has a green card that permitted permanent legal residency.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Trump was evidently referring to a policy that creates a class of immigrants called diversity immigrants from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States.About 50,000 diversity visas are distributed annually among six geographic regions, and no single country receives more than 7 percent of the available visas in one year, according to the State Department website.The program has been a target of conservatives, who proposed eliminating it in legislation endorsed by Mr. Trump that would crack down on legal immigration.The legislation would slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country.Whether Mr. Saipov actually came into the country through the diversity visa program was not immediately confirmed by government officials, but conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart News quickly blamed the program and pointed the finger at Mr. Schumer.Mr. Trump, who during last years campaign called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has long sought to close the borders to many outsiders.He has signed several versions of a travel ban aimed mainly at countries with Muslim majorities even as courts repeatedly intervened.He has embraced plans to cut the number of refugees allowed into the country as well as legal immigrants.Mr. Saipov came from Uzbekistan, which was not among the countries targeted by Mr. Trumps travel restrictions.A former Soviet republic, it has over the years hosted American and other Western military forces as part of the war in neighboring Afghanistan, although it forced the United States to close a base there in 2005 after a human rights dispute following a massacre.Likewise, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest Uzbekistan was part of Europe instead of Central Asia.The attack on Mr. Schumer offered a timely way for Mr. Trump to change the subject from the special counsel investigation that unveiled its first criminal charges this week against three campaign advisers to Mr. Trump.It also served to reassure Mr. Trumps conservative base, which was nervous after the president seemed to find common cause with Chuck and Nancy, meaning Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.After Tuesday evenings attack in New York, other Republicans pressed Mr. Trump to dispense with legal protections for the suspect in New York and declare him an enemy combatant.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and a onetime critic of Mr. Trump who has lately become an ally, praised the presidents tough stance.The one thing I like about President Trump, he understands that we are in a religious war, Mr. Graham told Fox News on Tuesday night, before the presidents Twitter posts about Mr. Schumer and immigration.And to the American people, we are fighting people who are compelled by their religious views to kill us all.They kill fellow Muslims who dont agree with their view of Islam.They kill Christians, vegetarians, libertarians, you name it.So were in a war.
Paul Manafort’s Trail of Scandals:::::President Trumps former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been charged with tax fraud and money laundering.But this isnt Mr. Manaforts first public scandal.
Andrew Weissmann, Mueller’s Legal Pit Bull:::::Im no fan of Donald Trump, said Dan Cogdell, a Houston defense lawyer who tangled with Mr. Weissmann when Mr. Weissmann helped lead the federal task force investigating Enron in the early 2000s.Frankly, I cant think of two people who deserve each other more than Andrew Weissmann and Donald Trump.If Mr. Mueller is the stern-eyed public face of the investigation, Mr. Weissmann, 59, is its pounding heart, a bookish, legal pit bull with two Ivy League degrees, a weakness for gin martinis and classical music and a list of past enemies that includes professional killers and white-collar criminals.Empowered by Mr. Mueller, for whom he previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I., Mr. Weissmann has taken the lead in the governments case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trumps former campaign chairman, whose indictment jolted the capital on Monday in a clear signal of the teams seriousness.Mr. Weissmann could be seen at an initial hearing in Washington with an easy smile, chatting up Mr. Manaforts lawyer during a break in the action.Friends describe Mr. Weissmann as relentless and boundary-grazing but fundamentally fair, a creative legal strategist whose hyperdiligence should not be confused with recklessness.He is the prosecutor they would want if their relatives were charged with crimes they did not commit, they say, and the one they would dread if their family members were guilty.If theres something to find, hell find it, said Katya Jestin, a former colleague in the United States attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York, who called Mr. Weissmanns ethics unimpeachable.If theres nothing there, hes not going to cook something up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But many defense lawyers have chafed at what they see as a scorched-earth approach, forged in Brooklyn while facing down Mafia members and refined on the governments unit of Enron superprosecutors, which left a mixed legacy of high-profile successes, overturned convictions and one unanimous defeat at the Supreme Court.It was Mr. Weissmann and his team who stunned Houston society by charging the wife of Enrons chief financial officer with tax fraud, applying pressure on the executive, who became a star witness.It was Mr. Weissmann, more recently, who oversaw the predawn raid of Mr. Manaforts Virginia residence in July, when federal agents picked his lock and prosecutors communicated their intention to indict him.When that moment came this week, representatives for Mr. Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates were given little warning: Prosecutors bypassed the common Justice Department practice of inviting lawyers to meet and discuss potential indictments beforehand, often an opportunity for the defense to argue for leniency and for prosecutors to identify potential holes in their case.As of Friday, people close to both men said they had received no indication that an indictment was imminent.And while Mr. Mueller has remained the chief villain in the eyes of the presidents allies in conservative news media, efforts to discredit Mr. Weissmann have picked up.For months, Mr. Trumps defenders have sought to draw attention to thousands of dollars in past donations from Mr. Weissmann to Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.Then came the shock-and-awe raid of Mr. Manaforts home a Weissmann special, both admirers and critics recognized the Zorro Z to announce his presence in the case.Theres a name, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh warned listeners last week, recapping the intimidating technique afoot.Weissmann.Prosecuting Mob Bosses Prosecution can make strange bedfellows.And still this alliance stood out.On one end of the negotiating table sat Mr. Weissmann, the Princeton-educated son of a psychologist and a research scientist who is credited with codiscovering, and coining the term, liposomes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the other was Salvatore Gravano, a hitman-turned-informant better known as Sammy the Bull.Mr. Weissmann and his team used Mr. Gravano as an explosive ally in their bid to prosecute high-ranking mobsters.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the case of Mr. Gigante, Mr. Weissmann and his colleagues leaned on Mr. Gravanos testimony, in large part, to dismantle a long-held insanity defense.Mr. Gigante, nicknamed The Oddfather, had been known to wander Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and pajamas, mumbling incoherently, tending to a feigned image of incompetence and cluelessness.Ive invested many years in this crazy act, Mr. Gravano quoted Mr. Gigante as saying during court proceedings.Mr. Weissmann, who declined to be interviewed for this article, even demonstrated that Mr. Gigantes bathrobes were chosen with care: In public, his coverings were soiled and tattered.Inside, he slipped into something pristine.They respected him, George A. Stamboulidis, Mr. Weissmanns trial partner, said of his colleague and their mob witnesses.Hes very bright and to the point but also has a pretty good read of his audience.It was definitely a relationship of mutual respect.Geoffrey S. Mearns, a former prosecutor in the Eastern District who is now the president of Ball State University in Indiana, said Mr. Weissmanns personality mirrored that of the office with its collection of scrappy, ambitious obsessives out to prove their relative mettle in a city where another office, the Southern District in Manhattan, was often viewed as more prestigious.That their targets were some of the citys most fearsome murderers tended to focus the mind, as well.He was trained in this environment that we were essentially going after these entrenched mob bosses, Mr. Mearns said.Hes trained as a prosecutor to be aggressive.I Dont Drink Evian The locals did not all take well to their visitors from the federal government, dispatched to Houston after the collapse of Enron to investigate and prosecute the companys fraud.Out-of-town, carpetbagging, Evian-swilling Department of Justice lawyers, read one description in The Houston Chronicle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This was an outrage, Mr. Weissmann told a reporter then.I dont drink Evian.It was this swagger that helped define the governments posture as the task force went about its work, first with Mr. Weissmann as deputy director, then later as director.(Mr. Mueller, as F.B.I.director at the time, helped form the group.)Their triumphs were many: With little precedent for such a complex inquiry into financial wrongdoing, the team won indictments and prison terms for almost all of the companys top executives.Mr. Weissmann was credited with acting on a hunch that Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former Enron treasurer who had already pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate, might be willing to say more.United States marshals hauled in Mr. Glisan from prison, at Mr. Weissmanns direction, to appear before a grand jury.He became a key witness.Prosecutors also initially earned a conviction of Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm charged with illegally destroying documents related to its audit of Enron, for obstruction of justice.Colleagues praised his resourcefulness and legal guile.Opponents accused him of overreach, citing a series of overturned convictions and higher-court losses.Among the setbacks for the task force, the Arthur Andersen victory was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court over a narrow issue involving jury instructions.Long before that outcome, the case had drawn ferocious criticism from members of the business community, who argued that the indictment alone amounted to a death sentence for the firm.Its pretty clear that Weissmann created a culture in which they presumed that the people they were investigating were guilty, said Tom Kirkendall, a Houston defense lawyer who represented clients on Enron-related cases.This reputation has trailed Mr. Weissmann among some defense lawyers in the years since, propagated most vocally by a lawyer and author, Sidney Powell, whose work has been taken up by Trump allies like Newt Gingrich.(In 2015, Ms. Powell criticized Mr. Weissmann in an article for The New York Observer which was owned by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumps son-in-law after Mr. Weissmann was named to lead the Justice Departments criminal fraud section.)But those close to Mr. Weissmann and some others less inclined to appreciate the work of prosecutors generally have zealously defended his ethical compass.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Peter Neufeld, a civil rights lawyer and a founder of the Innocence Project, praised Mr. Weissmanns nerve during his time at the F.B.I., as the agency grappled with the fallout of exonerations based on erroneous testimony from forensic hair examiners.He realized that what had gone on in the past was wrong, Mr. Neufeld said, recalling Mr. Weissmanns decision to order an audit of hundreds of convictions that may have relied on faulty testimony.He did it.That was transformative.By 2013, both Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Mueller had left the agency.It seemed unlikely that they would partner again.Then came the call last spring.
Trump Belittles George Papadopoulos as ‘Low Level’ Adviser:::::The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm, Mr. Trump wrote.What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering.He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled.Fake News weak!Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, were charged in a 12-count indictment with a series of money laundering, tax evasion and foreign lobbying crimes stemming from work for pro-Russian political leaders in Ukraine.While the crimes alleged began years before Mr. Trumps campaign, the indictment asserted that Mr. Manaforts scheme to defraud continued through last year until early this year.Mr. Papadopoulos was named by Mr. Trump in March 2016 as one of five foreign policy advisers.While the president and his team now seek to minimize Mr. Papadopouloss importance, at the time Mr. Trump described him in flattering terms.Hes an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy, he told The Washington Post.According to a statement of offense signed as part of his guilty plea, Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that he spent months last year cultivating contacts in an effort to arrange meetings between Mr. Trumps campaign and Russian government officials.Mr. Papadopoulos said a London-based professor with extensive Russian contacts introduced him to a woman described as Putins niece and told him the Russians had dirt on Mrs. Clinton based on thousands of emails of hers.(The woman was not actually related to President Vladimir V.Putin.)The professor, identified on Monday by a Senate aide as Joseph Mifsud, told Mr. Papadopoulos about the emails in April 2016, three months before WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 hacked Democratic emails.Mr. Papadopoulos kept senior campaign officials informed about his efforts and they encouraged him but made clear they wanted to keep some distance publicly.It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal, a top campaign official wrote in an email at the time.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Papadopoulos was not charged with any crime for making those efforts but instead pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I.agents about the matter.He was arrested secretly in late July and has been cooperating ever since with the team of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.George was a low-level volunteer who might have attended a meeting of the foreign policy advisory team, the one meeting that took place but he was not a person who was involved with the day-to-day operations of the campaign, or a person who I recall interacting with on a regular basis at all, Corey Lewandowski, who ran the campaign before Mr. Manafort, said on the Today show on NBC on Tuesday.Mr. Lewandowski said he did not learn about the hacked Democratic emails until they became public.To the best of my knowledge, absolutely not, he said.When I found out about that, I found out about it through public press reports.He added that he has not spoken with the F.B.I.but would be happy to do that unequivocally.Mr. Papadopouloss efforts are the second known effort by a member of Mr. Trumps team to obtain damaging information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russians.Several weeks after the meeting where Mr. Papadopoulos learned about the Clinton emails, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Manafort and Jared Kushner, the future presidents son-in-law, met with a Russian lawyer after being promised incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They said later that the meeting did not yield such information, but the president has defended their decision to take the meeting as a routine opposition research.The original statement to The New York Times by Donald Trump Jr. describing the meeting, crafted with the participation of the president, omitted the promise of damaging information.Mr. Mueller is now looking into that statement.In Moscows initial reaction to Mr. Muellers indictments, Russian state-run news media and government representatives on Tuesday emphasized that the accusations laid out against Mr. Manafort did not mention Russia.Instead, media reports highlighted that he was accused for his actions in Ukraine.But his work in Ukraine was for the pro-Russian party of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was driven out of office by street protests in 2014.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlins spokesman, called all accusations of Russias involvement in last years election laughable, unqualified, groundless and unsubstantiated.From what we have read in the media and seen in the statements by participants of this process, so far Russia was not mentioned in any way in the accusations, other countries were, Mr. Peskov said at his regular news briefing.Moscow has never felt guilty to feel vindicated now, Mr. Peskov said.We were always puzzled about these groundless and unsubstantiated accusations of Russias alleged involvement in American elections, he said.We have resolutely denied them from the beginning and we deny them now.American social media companies told Congress on Monday that Russia was prolific in its efforts to reach American voters last year to sow discord.Russian agents published inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Googles YouTube service, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Times.
The Dossier Freakout:::::The dossier that wont die.Check the DEMS!President Trump tweeted yesterday.We now have evidence that Democrats literally paid money for Russian intelligence, Fox Newss Tucker Carlson claimed on his show.The Democrat-Fusion-Russia story requires as full an investigation as the question of Trump-Russia collusion, The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote.Several readers have emailed me asking for help in making sense of this story, which is often known as the dossier story.Here goes: Last year, a big law firm called Perkins Coie, which was working for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, hired a research firm named Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Opposition research is standard practice in politics, and its not pretty.It involves looking for dirt on an opponent and then publicizing that dirt.When you read an expos in a major media organization about a political candidate, it sometimes started with old-fashioned investigative reporting but other times it started with a handout from the opposition-research arm of a competing campaign.Fusion is known for doing opposition research.During the Republican primaries, a conservative website funded, in large part, by Paul Singer, a Republican billionaire who didnt want Trump to win the nomination, hired Fusion to look into Trump.After he did win the nomination, the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C.hired Fusion and, through the law firm, paid for the research.Fusion worked with a well-regarded former British spy named Christopher Steele to produce a dossier that accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia.The dossier also included salacious and unproven, if not false stories about Trumps personal behavior.Trump and his media allies have tried to downplay his campaigns Russia dealings by saying the Clinton campaigns financing of the dossier was even worse.Its classic whataboutism, and its part of Trumps effort to sow confusion about the allegations against him.Its also a silly comparison.Clintons campaign was engaging in the usual, if tough, practice of trying to uncover information that makes an opponent look bad.Trumps campaign, by contrast, was potentially colluding with a foreign government hostile to the United States to disseminate stolen material with Trump then lying about it and trying to prevent a federal investigation of it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trumps entire defense amounts to elementary school taunt: I know you are, but what am I?writes Max Boot, summarizing a piece hes written for Foreign Policy.The dossier intrigue is part of a frantic effort to distract attention from what we do know, which is that Russia tried to meddle in the election, Ruth Marcus has said on CBS.Not for the first time, The Los Angeles Timess editorial board notes, the president and his allies are seizing on a sideshow to distract attention from the main event.In The Times.Regular readers know that I consider the lack of economic diversity at the nations top public and private colleges to be inexcusable.In an op-ed, Paul Glastris of The Washington Monthly offers another good idea for improving the situation: these colleges should admit more adults people who have spent years working before enrolling in (or returning to) college.Also, for the latest news on the New York terror attack, follow The Timess news coverage.
Navy Collisions That Killed 17 Sailors Were ‘Avoidable,’ Official Inquiry Reports:::::The collisions were avoidable, Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said in a summary of the two reports, released by the Navy on Wednesday morning.The release of the twin reports on the collisions came a day after the Navy held closed-door briefings for lawmakers on Capitol Hill on its findings and recommendations, and sent officers crisscrossing the country to brief family members of the sailors killed.A broader review of the Seventh Fleets pace of operations, training, equipment and maintenance is to be released on Thursday.Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, attributed the two fatal collisions to dwindling Navy resources in the Pacific, combined with judgment and training errors a sentiment echoed by lawmakers as they left Tuesdays private hearing.In general, were asking too few ships to do too many things, Mr. Wicker said.Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Tuesday also pointed to the automatic budget cuts on the Pentagon since 2013, known as sequestration, as one of the primary culprits behind the combined 17 deaths aboard the two destroyers.Weve deprived them of the funds to do it, Mr. McCain said of the continuous operations in the Pacific.Were putting those men and women in harms way to be wounded or killed because we refuse to give them the sufficient training and equipment and readiness.Its a failure of Congress.Its on us.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Already the fallout from the two fatal crashes, as well as two others in the western Pacific this year, has been dramatic.The commander of the Navys Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H.

Joseph P. Aucoin, the former head of the Seventh Fleet, based in Japan and the Navys largest overseas, was removed in connection with the accidents.The Navys top officer for ships worldwide, Vice Adm. Thomas S. Rowden, has also said he will retire early.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Several other senior officers in the Seventh Fleet chain of command, as well as the commanding officers of the Fitzgerald and John S. McCain, have also been relieved of their duties.Even before the more comprehensive review was conducted by Adm.

Trump’s Official Portrait Resembles a Smiley Emoji:::::Instead, it depicts Mr. Trump in front of the de rigueur American flag, in a navy suit with flag pin, white shirt, patterned blue tie and big grin.The orange glow has been toned down, but it is the smile that really sticks out.It almost looks as if hes being tickled.The word chortle comes to mind.That the president and his team chose this image of benign cheer to adorn government offices across the country and to represent his administration is pretty striking, not simply because it seems to suggest Hey, Im enjoying this gig or because it is counter to so much of Mr. Trumps usual threatening, fight-picking, wall-building posturing.It is also something of an anomaly in the presidential portrait continuum, where the exhibition of restrained gravitas often seems to be the overriding imperative.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This generally means folded arms, and a sort-of smile.Occasionally, teeth are involved, but even then, the glee is measured.The first official portrait of Barack Obama, for example, in 2009, featured the then-president looking seriously at the camera, the sides of his mouth just beginning to quirk upward more of a suggestion of a smile than an actual one.In 2013, for his second term, his portrait showed him looking pretty cheerful, but posing in front of his desk with arms crossed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story His predecessor, George W. Bush, had his photo taken in the Roosevelt Room, and while his eyes were crinkled genially, his smile was contained.That it took Mr. Trump, who was known to choose his own photos during the campaign, and his team so long to settle on the smiley image suggests a deliberate choice, especially for an administration where appearance has always been part of the calculus (all those central casting generals).Which either means were about to see a new side of the man, or that hes trying to hedge his bets.Trick or treat?
A.C.L.U. Sues Trump Administration Over Detention of 10-Year-Old Immigrant:::::Photo The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over its detention of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who was stopped by Border Patrol agents in Texas last week on her way to surgery.The girl, Rosa Maria Hernandez, had been living in Laredo, Tex., with her parents, where she was brought illegally from Mexico when she was 3 months old.Her case became a new flash point in a national debate over the administrations hard-line immigration policies, eliciting outcries from members of Congress as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics, an advocacy group.The A.C.L.U.argues in its suit that Border Patrol agents illegally and erroneously detained Rosa Maria, who was traveling to a hospital in Corpus Christi to have gallbladder surgery, under the pretext that she is an unaccompanied minor.The lawsuit, filed in a United States District Court in San Antonio, further argues that the government violated Rosa Marias constitutional rights by separating her from her parents without due process.The A.C.L.U.asked the court for a temporary restraining order against the government to allow her immediate release.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This case is shocking, Michael Tan, an A.C.L.U.lawyer working on Rosa Marias case, said in a phone interview on Tuesday evening.And all of us who do immigration work are concerned that this is the new normal.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
America Is Not a ‘Center-Right Nation’:::::The political scientist Philip Converse first brought the first reality to national attention in 1964.In his classic essay The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics, Mr. Converse demonstrated that only 17 percent of American voters could both correctly assign the terms liberal and conservative to the nations two major political parties and offer a sensible description of what those terms meant.The rest of the electorate did not understand politics as a fight over abstract theories of good government but rather a conflict between interest groups.Ordinary voters did not select the party that most faithfully represented their political philosophy they picked the one that appeared to best represent their people, a group they might define with reference to class, region, religion, race or partisanship itself.This make intuitive sense: The left-to-right political spectrum is a construct born of seating arrangements during the French Revolution.The impulse to define oneself in relation to an in-group and opposition to an out-group is a survival strategy thats been with us since the dawn of our species.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.And in their recent book Neither Liberal Nor Conservative: Ideological Innocence in the American Public, the political scientists Donald Kinder and Nathan Kalmoe show that the electorate is scarcely more ideological today, at the peak of partisan polarization, than it was at the height of the New Deal consensus (when Mr. Converse published his landmark study).Thus, while its true that fewer Americans self-identify as liberal than as moderate or conservative, this tells us almost nothing about voters policy views.Moderates do not actually display a preference for centrist positions, but merely for ideologically inconsistent ones.In fact, the Stanford political scientist David Broockman has shown that moderates are just as likely to subscribe to extreme policy positions as other voters are: In the United States, there are self-identified moderates who support a $1 million maximum income, prohibiting gays and lesbians from teaching public school and the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants.Meanwhile, the number of genuine liberals and conservatives is far smaller than meets the eye.Most voters who identify with those terms are partisans first, and ideologues second.Or as Mr. Kinder and Mr. Kalmoe conclude an analysis of four decades of voter survey data, ideological identification seems more a reflection of political decisions than a cause.In other words: The average conservative Republican isnt a Republican because shes a conservative she self-identifies as a conservative because shes a Republican.One crucial implication of this finding is that political elites have enormous power to dictate ideological terms to their rank-and-file supporters.For a healthy chunk of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, the liberal and conservative position on most issues is whatever their party leaders say it is.Donald Trumps success at redefining conservative voters consensus views on free trade, American policy toward Russia and the relevance of personal morality to effective political leadership offers a particularly vivid illustration of this phenomenon.When we look past ideological self-identification to polling on discrete public policy questions, America appears to be far more center-left than center-right.In a recent analysis of Democracy Fund Voter Study Group survey data, the political scientist Lee Drutman found that 73.5 percent of the 2016 electorate espoused broadly left-of-center views on economic policy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That finding is supported by polling on individual fiscal issues over the past year.Recent surveys have shown that most Americans including majorities of Republican voters support increasing federal financing of health care and oppose cutting taxes for the wealthy.And theres little evidence that the Democrats left flank is exhausting the publics tolerance for government intervention in the economy: Recent polls have found that over 60 percent of Americans support tuition-free public college (a majority that includes 58 percent of independents and 47 percent of Republicans); that over 60 percent of all voters favor Medicaid and Medicare buy-in programs, while a slim majority likes the sound of single-payer; and that 82 percent of voters, including 70 percent of Republicans, support new legislation expanding access to paid family and medical leave.The Democratic Party has failed to translate the popularity of progressive economics into electoral success for a variety of reasons.The most fundamental is the one weve already observed: Most voters cast their ballots on the basis of identity, not policy.And Americas rapidly changing demographics and the rights steadfast efforts to inflame and exploit anxieties about those changes have made racial identity increasingly salient to white voters, particularly rural ones.This development, combined with the disproportionate influence that our political system awards to white rural voters, has given Republicans a structural advantage.Democrats have all kinds of ways of addressing this problem.One would be to cultivate the class identity of white voters by embracing populist rhetoric that paints the billionaire class as an out-group they can define themselves against.Another would be to invest more resources into registering nonwhite voters.According to the Census Bureau, 74 percent of non-Hispanic whites are registered to vote in the United States.For African-Americans, that figure is 69 percent; for Hispanics, 57; and for Asian-Americans, 56.As the policy analyst Sean McElwee has noted, this means that even if every registered Latino voter in America went to the polls last November, Latinos overall turnout rate still would have been lower than it was for whites (63 percent).Embracing a more conservative economic agenda, however, would solve none of the Democrats problems.At a time of historic inequality, rampant corporate consolidation and environmental crisis, the case for more robust redistributive social programs and public-interest regulations is strong.When centrist Democrats claim that making such a case is electoral suicide, they reveal less about the American publics stubbornly center-right convictions than about their own.
An Alaska Senator Wants to Fight Climate Change and Drill for Oil, Too:::::The debates importance, though, may ultimately go well beyond the fate of the Arctic refuge.Analysts say Senator Murkowskis

Center, a libertarian think tank.Were going to have to address conservative concerns and policy demands.Its not unfair for environmentalists to argue that if you take climate change seriously, it simply requires the rapid decarbonization of the economy.Full stop.Climate change is real and demands a policy response, Mr. Taylor said.Of Senator Murkowski, he added, Her skepticism is about that policy response.Anything thats going to increase oil and gas prices is something shes going to be very skeptical about.Senator Murkowski has walked a delicate line on climate change for much of her 15 years in Congress.She routinely acknowledges that the climate is changing and that warming poses a threat to Alaska.This year, she urged President Trump not to withdraw from the Paris agreement.But she also has championed natural gas exports, expanding offshore and onshore drilling and the 2016 lifting of a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.She has introduced legislation to open the Arctic wilderness every term she has served in the Senate.The senator, for her part, said she sees no inconsistencies in her views.I think for anybody who has spent any time in Alaska, there is an awareness that we all have that we are seeing the impacts of climate change perhaps more readily than in other parts of the country because of our Arctic environment, Senator Murkowski said in an interview.But were also a place where we recognize that in order to stay warm, we have to have a resource that can keep us warm, and oil has been a mainstay for us, she said.Weve provided it to the country and that has allowed for jobs and revenues, it has allowed for schools and roads and institutions that everybody else around the country enjoys.Money from oil and gas development is a critical source of income in Alaska.Since the completion of the trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline in 1977, petroleum revenues have averaged more than 85 percent of the state budget.According to the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, petroleum supports a third of all jobs in the state.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Champions of opening the refuge assert that shifting Alaskas economy will take time, and, despite gains in renewable power, the reality is that oil will be around for decades to come.On Thursday, the debate over the Arctic refuge begins in earnest.A budget blueprint passed by the House and Senate in recent weeks has set the stage for Republicans to overhaul the tax code with the support of only 50 senators, rather than the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.The budget blueprint also paves the way for a drilling measure to be attached to the tax overhaul.Using that approach, Republicans would be able to open the refuge to drilling without encountering a filibuster.The Trump administration has cited possible revenues to federal coffers totaling $1.8 billion by 2018.Senator Murkowskis energy panel, where Republicans hold a majority, could vote as early as next week to approve legislation directing part of the refuge opened.Democrats have vowed to fight the effort.Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the senior Democrat on the energy committee, pointed to a recent congressional audit warning that global warming had already cost the country billions of dollars.Alaskas outdoor and tourism economy already generates more jobs than the oil economy, Senator Cantwell said.Personally, I would be working to protect that outdoor wildlife economy instead of undermining it by drilling in the Arctic.Proponents of drilling point to Energy Information Administration estimates projecting that oil and gas will account for more than half the worlds energy supply through 2050, despite the gains in renewable power.Kara Moriarty, president and chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, has asserted that Alaskas contribution to climate change is minuscule and it will continue to be small even if new drilling does occur in the refuge.If we were to immediately shut down production activity that is occurring, even if we went to zero, it is not going to make a difference in stopping any kind of change in our climate, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a case that Senator Murkowski makes as well.The answer, she argues, lies in using oil revenues to pave the way for alternative energy sources.Its not something that can be done overnight, and it is something that can only be done if you have resources, she said.Alaska, Senator Murkowski said, embraces clean energy and has devoted state resources to boosting capital for distributed energy and developing micro-grids to power remote parts of the country.For the people who live and work and raise their families in a very small population state, we dont think we are the problem, Senator Murkowski said.We think we are the answer.
Senate Intel Chairman: Russians on Social Media Did Not Elect Trump:::::Mr. Burr noted that five times more ads were targeted to Maryland, a safely Democratic state, than Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump narrowly carried.He said that more ads were targeted to Washington, D.C., an overwhelmingly Democratic area, than Pennsylvania.And he said that of the $1,979 spent ads in Wisconsin, all but $54 was spent before the primary.He went on, but the message was clear.This isnt about relitigating the 2016 presidential election.This isnt about who one and who lost, Mr. Burr said.This is about national security.This is about corporate responsibility.And this is about the deliberate and multifaceted manipulation of the American people by agents of a hostile foreign power.Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, picked up the line of questioning, as he pressed social media executives on the content of Russian advertising.My view of this is this is a whole lot broader than simply the 2016 election, he said.The executives agreed that Russian efforts were geared more toward sowing social discord that advocating directly for Mr. Trump or against Hillary Clinton.But as Democrats noted, discord helped Mr. Trumps grievance-based campaign.The Russian effort was to sow conflict and discontent all over this country, said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.Facebook defends reasons for taking down ads.As senators pressed Facebooks general counsel, Colin Stretch, on Facebooks role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebooks explanation has been the issue of authentic accounts.Since Facebook went public with its findings, the companys reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That distinction is key for Facebook.Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.We dont take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share, Mr.Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they werent fake.Does it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?Mr. Burr asked Facebooks general counsel.Mr.Stretch didnt directly answer.The authenticity issue is the key, Mr.Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.Ads were only one way Russia influenced the election Political ads are just part of the problem, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said at Wednesdays first hearing.Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race.On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans.However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg, Mr. Warner said.The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twitter is still lowballing Russian intrusion.Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported.But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 bots that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election.The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.The new numbers still seem low, according to Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.Video Im concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation.Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts or potentially 48 million accounts are fake or automated, Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.With Facebooks acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, tells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem, Mr. Burr said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Your actions need to catch up to your responsibilities, he added.The executives left a judiciary subcommittee wanting.Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better.The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases would protect the United States from outside influence.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month.Every minute.Probably every second.You dont have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online.In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.The House committee will release copies of the Russian ads.The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks chief operating officer.A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.Facebooks bullish posture to Wall Street.Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the days second hearing.The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With its stock trading at a record high and the companys market capitalization over $500 billion more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan Facebooks business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments.But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting.Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.The problem is worse than originally thought.Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Googles YouTube service.The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the companys initial efforts showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and organic posts harnessed by foreign powers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Transparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages, Mr. Schiff said recently.
How Russian Bots and Trolls Invade Our Lives — and Elections:::::How do bots and trolls work to infiltrate social media platforms and influence U.S. elections?We take a closer look at these insidious online pests to explain how they work.
Constitutional Convention: Thanks, but No Thanks:::::Photo That the mechanisms of New York State governance require serious repair is beyond dispute.A campaign finance system that fosters corruption and creates kingmakers of moneyed interests cries out for a thorough overhaul.The incumbent protection racket known as gerrymandering must end.The voting process needs to be reinvented to stimulate anemic turnouts.And greater home rule for New York City and other municipalities is essential: Its absurd that the city, for instance, needs Albanys permission for something as prosaic as lowering speed limits on its own streets.These and other issues could be fodder for a state constitutional convention, arguably a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape New York democracy.Every 20 years, under law, a question must be put before the electorate, as it will be again on Tuesday for the first time since 1997.Voters will get to say aye or nay to this, Ballot Proposal 1: Shall there be a convention to revise the Constitution and amend the same?For the most part, New Yorkers have not cottoned to con-cons, to use a common shorthand.They voted no 20 years ago, just as they did 40 and 60 years ago.Except for a convention in the mid-1960s initiated by the Legislature a fruitless exercise, since its proposals were ultimately shot down at the ballot box no assemblage of this kind has been held since 1938.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 1997 we urged a yes vote, reasoning that state government was a paralytic wreck and opportunities for reform were rare.Its tempting to make the same argument now.The Constitution is a bloated relic, reaching back to 1894 and rattling on for more than 50,000 words, seven times the length of the United States Constitution, amendments included.And the fact that most major politicians in the state oppose a convention do they quake at the mere thought of reform?is in itself an invitation to say yes.
Manafort’s Spending Fails to Impress in Wealthy Enclaves:::::The amount Mr. Manafort is said to have spent on clothing at a store in New York $849,000 between 2008 and 2014 earned a fair amount of mockery and disbelief online.But at least one luxury retailer on Madison Avenue said that amount spread over six years an average of $141,500 per year amounts to a large but not unprecedented annual outlay for a shopper of the 1 percent interested in luxury tailoring and clothes.The fact of the matter is, we have many brand enthusiasts who love the made-to-measure process and regularly spend over $100,000 a year with us, said Sarrah Candee, the senior director of global marketing and public relations for Isaia, the Neapolitan luxury brand, whose suits, most of which sell for $4,000 to $5,000, are a mark of pride among the sartorially conscious.(With their slim-shouldered silhouettes, they are more rakish than the power suits Mr. Manafort prefers.)Ms. Candee said that Mr. Manafort had not, to her knowledge, been a client, but others who worked with him did not assess his style as discerning.Alan Flusser, the New York-based mens wear designer and author, said that Mr. Manafort had first been brought to him through Roger J.Stone Jr., an ally of Mr. Trumps, in the 1980s.Mr. Flusser said Mr. Manafort was more into the Michael Douglas-Gordon Gekko imagery than the Brooks Brothers, inside-the-Beltway, button-down look.He was a little flashier, Mr. Flusser said, trying to project an aura of power and success.Jay Fielden, the editor of Esquire, said Mr. Manaforts fondness for House of Bijan reminded him of somewhat edgier pop culture figures.Its like he watched Goodfellas and then found a tailor who could update that particular kind of sartorial razzle-dazzle, Mr. Fielden said.You see a guy like that coming at you and you know hes either going to shoot you or sell you something.Reports of Mr. Manaforts spending made their way to Alexandria, where shopkeepers on Tuesday flitted from store to store to share gossip.Nabi Nasseri, who owns Art Underfoot, an antique rug gallery, said he had never worked with Mr. Manafort.He was not, he said, Vendor C. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nasseri said that his shop, which is filled floor to ceiling with about 1,000 silk and woolen rugs, some with prices up to $8,900, could not come close to clearing the price listed in the indictment.Id have a lot more money if he had been a customer, Mr. Nasseri said.Across the street, at J&J Oriental Rugs, Joseph Nabatkhorian, the shops co-owner, was less welcoming: I cant talk about that, Mr. Nabatkhorian said when asked whether Mr. Manafort had been a client.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Madeleine Mitchell, the gallery director for Doris Leslie Blau Antique Rugs, buys and designs high-end rugs for embassies and hotels.She was skeptical that the rugs were bought purely for show and not to hide money in an expensive item that would grow in value.None of my clients would spend $900,000 on rugs, Ms. Mitchell added, and they have all the money in the world.In the Hamptons, Mr. Manaforts spending sent mixed signals to real estate observers.Since the early 1990s, a two-plus-acre plot at 174 Jobs Lane in Bridgehampton has belonged to the Manafort family, with a full-size tennis court, half a basketball court, a 720-square-foot outdoor pool, a hot tub and an outdoor pool house.Diane Saatchi, a broker at Saunders & Associates, one of the bigger real estate firms in the Hamptons, said that a pool house renovation in 2015 and 2016, priced at $420,000, was a lot of money for a pool house.Of the $800,000 landscaping tab, Ms. Saatchi said that the house did not seem like a manicured property.He couldve spent that, Ms. Saatchi said, but close to $200,000 a year seems expensive given the size and style.Im going to take a wild guess that if he paid that much just to maintain the landscape, he was overcharged.Other expenditures seemed in line with what people pay in the area.Perry Guillot, a prominent landscape architect in Southampton, said he was not surprised to hear that the complaint described the Manaforts $112,000 in audio and video installation costs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That doesnt get you a home theater with lean-back leather seats, a great projector and a popcorn machine, Mr. Guillot said.If were trying to put him up with the hedge fund guys, those numbers dont match that story.In November 2016, ownership of the Manafort property in the Hamptons was transferred to Sun Breeze L.L.C.Scott Segal, a real estate lawyer based in Manhattan, said there were a few reasons someone might choose to take that step.One reason, Mr. Segal said, is that its a way of limiting his liability to the asset.
That Crazy Talk About Robert Mueller:::::Theres no bottom to the delusion on display.At this point, investigators could release videotapes of Vladimir Putin personally handing Mr. Trump a uranium-lined briefcase filled with stolen emails, and the right-wing armada would find a way to blame Mrs. Clinton.(This would be followed, of course, by a congressional investigation to identify who leaked the tapes.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.These efforts at obfuscation and misdirection would be laughable, but they are linked to a very real and dangerous move by Trump allies throughout right-wing media and the government to shut down the Russia investigation for good.Its no secret that Mr. Trump has been itching to get rid of Mr. Mueller since soon after his appointment as special counsel in May.Mr. Trumps advisers have told him that would be a terrible idea and have reportedly talked him out of it more than once.But the calls for such a move are now coming from some of the most influential voices in conservative media, as are other equally bad proposals, like urging that Mr. Mueller resign and that Mr. Trump pardon anyone and everyone caught up in the Russia investigation including himself.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump would be wise to continue to ignore these loony ideas and restrain his own authoritarian reflexes.The president of the United States, no less than any citizen, lives under the law, not above it; Mr. Muellers investigation is the embodiment of that fact.Removing him now, after he has already secured two indictments, including one for Mr. Trumps former campaign chief, and a guilty plea by a foreign-policy adviser, would send the message that Mr. Trump and his aides are accountable to no one.Over the last several weeks, a few top Republicans have found the courage to say out loud what a majority of Americans have known for a long time: With his erratic behavior and antidemocratic eruptions, Donald Trump is presenting a profound danger to security of the nation and the stability of the world order.So far, these dissidents have beat their chests in a safe space, giving eloquent speeches on their way out the door.But it will not be hard for them to turn their words into actions if Mr. Trump gives in to an impulse to fire Mr. Mueller.Do the math: Three Republican senators (looking at you, Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake), joining with 48 Democrats, could bring the Senate to a halt until Mr. Mueller was reinstated no tax cuts, no more judges confirmed.The scenario in which Mr. Mueller loses his job, or Mr. Trump further abuses his pardon power, is hypothetical and may it remain so but if it materializes, it will fall to Congress to defend the foundations of American democracy, the separation of powers and the rule of law.
A Capital Consumed by Talk of Scandal and Suspicion:::::Most unnerving for many here was the realization that Mr. Papadopoulos had been secretly arrested three months ago and cooperating with prosecutors ever since.Former colleagues sought to remember contacts they had with him, either last year when he was reaching out to the Russians or in recent weeks when he was working for the authorities.Is there a darker cloud over the Trump presidency?The answer is yes, said Ed Rogers, a prominent lobbyist and White House veteran of two Republican presidencies.Is it a thundershower or a hurricane setting in?Nobody knows.Mr. Trump argued for drizzle, dismissing Mr. Manaforts indictment on charges of money laundering and foreign lobbying as unrelated to the campaign and belittling Mr. Papadopoulos as a nobody.Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday in his first comment on the foreign policy adviser he once called an excellent guy.Instead, as he has done repeatedly in recent days, Mr. Trump sought to turn attention to Democrats, pointing to the resignation of Tony Podesta, the powerhouse Democratic lobbyist who also faces scrutiny by Mr. Mueller and whose brother, John D. Podesta, was Mrs. Clintons campaign chairman.The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm, Mr. Trump wrote.What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering.He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled.Fake News weak!In a city where everything seems to break down along party lines, reaction to the indictments was no different.If youre a never Trumper, or if youre with the media or a Democrat, this just confirms your wildest fears that Vladimir Putin is now running the White House, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist.But if youre a Republican, you dont see that this advances the narrative at all.Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, sounded ho-hum, saying the charges claimed tax fraud and lying to F.B.I.agents.If those allegations are true, youve got to wonder how those individuals made it through the birth canal, because it was bone-deep stupid, he said.But I dont know what they have to do with President Trumps campaign.Photo Other Republicans appeared eager to skirt the issue.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, shut down questions related to the case at a news conference on Tuesday.The special counsel has his job to do, and were going to concentrate on what were doing here in the Senate, Mr. McConnell said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, slipped past a stand of flags to leave a news conference Monday through the back door rather than take questions about the investigation, although he later spoke with reporters about the case.Much of the talk on Capitol Hill centered on whether Congress needed to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller.Senator Lindsey Graham was one of two Republicans who hastily introduced bills aimed at adding a layer of job security for Mr. Mueller in August.In the months since, the legislation has stalled, despite Democratic prodding.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont feel a sense of urgency, no, I dont, Mr. Graham said on Tuesday.This is something manufactured by the people in your business.I havent seen anybody in the White House say anything to suggest there is a reason Mr. Mueller needs to be dismissed.Mr. Grassley was indignant at the question.Its ridiculous for anybody to be asking me about firing, he said.Thats not an issue in the White House.The administration acknowledged that the investigation was disrupting its agenda.It is very distracting to the president, as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something, while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulder, John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Monday night.He suggested the investigation might wind down.It should wrap up soon, Mr. Kelly said.I mean, it would seem that theyre toward the end of the witness pile and I dont know how much longer it could possibly go on, but were in great hopes that it wraps up.That seemed to rank optimism over experience, given past investigations involving other presidents.Veteran lawyers said Mr. Muellers inquiry could last for months if not years.After venting on Twitter in the morning, the president tried to refocus attention on his tax-cutting package set to be released this week.Hosting business leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump said he wanted the House to pass the bill by Thanksgiving and the Senate by Christmas, a blindingly quick schedule for such major legislation even without the shadow of scandal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Every president, Republican or Democrat, always has distractions, Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers and one of Mr. Trumps guests, said afterward.Thats where leadership really counts.Leaders are able to focus on more than one thing and this president is focused I think rightly so on what it takes to grow this economy and create more jobs.But the investigation, coupled with the dysfunction and polarization in Washington, makes the chances of passing major tax legislation by the end of the year problematic.No one on Capitol Hill expects that to occur anytime soon, said Jim Manley, a longtime Senate Democratic aide.And in the meantime, theyre once again in a position where all these things are going to pile up.The president and Congress have until Dec. 8 to agree on spending bills to keep the federal government from closing down and have a limited window beyond that to raise the national debt ceiling to avoid a default.Mr. Trump and lawmakers are also at odds over legislation to prevent the potential deportation of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.The partisan in me wants to get another tub of popcorn and another glass of wine and watch how it all plays out, Mr. Manley said.But the former staffer in me is anxious to see this darkness leave so we can get back to legislating.I see nothing but chaos from here on out.
Trump, Niger and Connecting the Dots:::::Desertification is the trigger, and climate change and population explosions are the amplifiers.The result is a widening collapse of small-scale farming, the foundation of societies all over Africa.And that collapse is leading to a rising tide of economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism, Monique Barbut, who heads the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and guided me in Niger, explained.A few numbers: Niger, with rampant poverty and poor access to contraception, has one the highest birthrates in the world: 7.6 children per woman.I met a man there who boasted of 17 kids.Neighboring Nigeria is growing so fast it will replace the U.S. as the third-most-populous country in the world by 2050.Nigeria is a third bigger than Texas.Meanwhile, climate change in the region is so severe that nearby Senegals national weather bureau says that from 1950 to 2015, the average temperature there rose two degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall declined by about two inches.The Paris climate accord was designed to keep global average temperatures from rising two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100.In other words, parts of sub-Saharan Africa are already at heat levels that Paris was supposed to prevent by the end of the century and the region is heading for a four-degree rise, which will lead to the collapse of even more small farms and lead to a mad scramble of refugees toward Europe, competition for food and more unemployed males ready to join ISIS for $50 a month.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Barbut, as I reported, reinforced her point by showing me three maps of Africa with dots concentrated in the middle of the continent.Map No.1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in 2008.Map No.2: conflicts and food riots in 2007 and 2008.Map No.3: terrorist attacks in 2012.All the dots of all three maps cluster around Niger and its neighbors.Hello?And what is Trumps response to this reality?Its to focus solely on using the U.S. military to kill terrorists in Africa while offering a budget that eliminates U.S. support for global contraception programs; appointing climate-change deniers to all key environmental posts; pushing coal over clean energy; and curbing U.S. government climate research.In short, hes sending soldiers to fight a problem that is clearly being exacerbated by climate and population trends, while eliminating all our tools to mitigate these trends.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats just stupid, reckless and irresponsible and it evinces no ability to connect the dots or think without a box.But this is not only in Africa: Trump was obsessed with defeating ISIS in Syria and Iraq but with as few U.S. troops as possible.The only way he could do that was by tacitly allying with Iran, Syrias regime, Russia, pro-Iranian Shiite militias, and pro-U.S. Kurds, who were the main anti-ISIS forces on the ground.We could not defeat ISIS or stabilize Syria and Iraq without all of them.And what is Trumps strategy now?I have no clue.Weve distanced ourselves from the Kurds, moved to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran and added U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a country we also cant stabilize without the tacit help of Iran next door.If you know how these dots connect, please write.Also: How do we stabilize our border with Mexico and maintain our neighbors cooperation in holding back the main source of illegal immigration today refugees from Central America while pursuing trade policies that have weakened the Mexican peso and the Mexican economy and could lead that country to elect its own anti-American populist-nationalist?Nothing Trump ever says has a second paragraph.His whole shtick is just a first paragraph: Build a wall, tear up the Iran deal, tear up TPP, defeat ISIS, send troops to Niger and Afghanistan to kill terrorists, kill climate policy, kill family planning, cut taxes, raise military spending.Every box just marks an applause line he needed somewhere to get elected.Nothing connects and we will pay for that.Indeed, if you want to know what it looks like when a country follows a leader with no second paragraph and no ability to connect dots, visit London.I was there last week.Britains political system is in turmoil and its economy is facing declining growth prospects, because a bare majority voted to follow leaders with no second paragraph well just quit the European Union and everything will be fine, they said.Well, now its a fine little mess they have.The ruling Conservatives have no clue how to quit the E.U.without doing even more damage to their countrys future.Thats what happens when you vote for disrupters who never spent a second thinking through how all of their disruptions connect the morning after the morning after.Sound familiar?

Mnuchin Talks Taxes and That Vanishing Treasury Study:::::When you do distribution tables, you take a bunch of things like the corporate tax and you distribute them out, Mr. Mnuchin said, explaining that the lower rate for businesses should be viewed in conjunction with lower individual tax rates.Were focused on what does this mean to the middle income in terms of tax cuts.On a vanishing Treasury study Mr. Mnuchin defended his departments decision to remove a study from its website that found workers would reap little benefit from cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Instead, Mr. Mnuchin and the Trump administration pointed to a new study by Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, that shows middle-class households will reap thousands of dollars a year if tax rates for companies fall.To the extent that there was something that was completely inconsistent with what were publishing now, we thought it made sense to take down, he said.We didnt hide the fact that we took it off.What about the deficit?Republican deficit hawks seem to be going extinct these days, but Mr. Mnuchin said that he and President Trump remained mindful of a deteriorating fiscal situation.To sell tax cuts that will reduce revenue by $1.5 trillion over a decade, Mr. Mnuchin is sticking to the view that economic growth from the cuts will be an elixir.I think the president is very concerned, as weve said all along, about the debt going from $10 trillion to $20 trillion, Mr. Mnuchin said, referring to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office about the debt trajectory over the next decade.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Explaining that the revenue losses are not as large as they seem and that the acceleration in growth will be greater than many economists believe, Mr. Mnuchin made the case that the lower rates would essentially pay for themselves.For every percent of G.D.P., theres $2.5 trillion of additional revenues, he said.Will the market crash if the tax bill flops?Mr. Mnuchin came under fire in recent weeks after reports that he was threatening lawmakers that financial markets would tank if the tax bill faltered.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he said that he made no such warning and had only suggested that stock markets would do even better if the tax cuts passed.If you look at the stock market, as Ive said, the stock market is clearly up in anticipation of economic activity and economic growth from the Trump administration plan, Mr. Mnuchin said.A pivot to financial regulation If and when the tax bill is signed, Mr. Mnuchin will most likely turn more attention to financial regulation and working to make changes to the Dodd-Frank law.He said that he was optimistic that there could be bipartisan support for moves that would make community and regional banks more competitive and that there was a lot of discussion about raising the threshold of $50 billion in assets that forced banks to face tougher oversight.We think theres definitely aspects of Dodd-Frank that people think should be reformed, Mr. Mnuchin said of the prospects of Democrats working with Republicans on regulation.Not sweating the hot seat Prominent lawmakers such as Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, have called Mr. Mnuchin a sycophant and a liar for defending Mr. Trump and for arguing in favor of the Republican tax plan, saying it wont benefit the rich.Mr. Mnuchin insists he is not offended.I dont take it personally at all, Mr. Mnuchin said.I have a lot to do.I wake up every morning and we have a huge agenda.
Trump Plans for Nuclear Arsenal Require $1.2 Trillion, Congressional Review States:::::Those plans may grow more ambitious, senior administration officials say, as the White House seeks new ways to counter North Korea, push back against Iran and deal with significant nuclear modernization in both Russia and China.The authors of the Nuclear Posture Review were told they could consider the building of new types of nuclear weapons, even some now prohibited by treaty.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Any changes could drive up the estimated cost of rebuilding the nations arsenal, and the figures released Tuesday did not account for inflation, which independent experts say would drive the total figure to more than $1.6 trillion.The overall direction of the buildup may also end the discussion, driven by Mr. Obama during much of his term, about how to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American offensive and defensive planning.In the end Mr. Obama walked back from his vision, deciding against eliminating one leg of the triad made up of weapons carried aboard ground-based missiles, submarines and bombers and he rejected advice from some of his top nuclear strategists about how to bring the total number of deployed American weapons below 1,000, even if President Vladimir V. Putin was not willing to make similar cuts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Critics of the American arsenal, who grew increasingly frustrated with Mr. Obama, have urged Mr. Trump to pare back, for reasons of budget if not strategy.Two former senior military officials, William J. Perry, who served as secretary of defense, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, who served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the congressional report as a wake up call in a letter Tuesday to Mr. Trump.The report demonstrated that current plans to rebuild the nuclear arsenal are unsustainable and must be rethought, they wrote.The report, about 70 pages long, details nine cost-cutting options for Congress that run from relatively minor to more extensive.One option, for example, examined the savings if the administration decided to forego a new generation of nuclear cruise missiles low-flying weapons with stubby wings that, when dropped from a bomber, hug the ground to avoid enemy radars and air defenses.The weapon was endorsed by Mr. Obama, though it has been criticized by other Democratic nuclear experts, like William Perry, as destabilizing.In any event, its elimination would save only about $30 billion about 2.5 percent of the total nuclear expenditures.Another option called for deploying fewer submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles than currently planned.Over three decades, that would save $85 billion.Scrapping the aging land-based missiles altogether would result in the largest savings, $175 billion.It explodes the myth that the plans proponents have been trying to foist on us that its all of the above or nothing, said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington.The reality is that therere a number practical options to save tens of billions of dollars while still maintaining a robust nuclear force.The $1.2 trillion figure over three decades compares to annual expenditures for Medicare of about $650 billion and for Medicaid of about $550 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The stark reality underlined by C.B.O.is that unless the U.S. government finds a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nuclear weapons spending plan inherited by the Trump administration will pose a crushing affordability problem, said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.While Mr. Trump likes to take credit for the nuclear weapons push, the costly makeover actually began with Mr. Obama, despite his repeated calls for a world without nuclear weapons.Mr. Obama argued that by making nuclear weapons safer and more reliable, their numbers could eventually be reduced, setting the world on a path to their elimination.Some of Mr. Obamas aides, thinking that Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election, expected deep cuts in the $1 trillion plan.Mr. Trump inherited the costly makeover, and his first budget proposed to move fully ahead with the Obama administration approach and then some.In an August speech, he boasted that his administration was spending vast amounts on overhauling the nuclear arsenal.Administration critics and arms control advocates say the Congressional Budget Office report reveals how extraordinarily difficult it will become in future years to maintain the nuclear weapons plan and the administrations promises as the costs of the rebuilding program begin to soar.Many elements of Trumps nuclear spending spree are excessive and dangerous, said Tom Z. Collina, policy director at Ploughshares Fund.We would be safer and richer without them.Mr. Perry, the former defense secretary, argued last year in a New York Times Op-Ed article that eliminating the ground-based missiles would improve global security.These missiles are some of the most dangerous weapons in the world, he wrote.They could even trigger an accidental nuclear war because their vulnerability to pre-emptive strikes would, in a time of crisis, give the president an incentive to launch them.Critics see the nations launch-on-warning policy as greatly increasing the risk of accidental war.In the past, they note, false alerts have repeatedly brought the world to the brink of thermonuclear disaster.We should consider all aspects of our nuclear posture, and our conventional forces needs, Mr. Perry and General Cartwright wrote to Mr. Trump, before rushing headlong into these expensive and contentious development programs.
James Martin, Who Spurred G.O.P. Gains in the South, Dies at 99:::::Photo James D. Martin, a states-rights Republican whose squeaker loss in a 1962 race for the United States Senate from Alabama and election to the House two years later helped crack the Democratic Solid South, died on Monday at his home in Gadsden, Ala.He was 99.His death was confirmed by his wife, Patricia.Mr. Martin, who was the oldest living veteran of the House of Representatives, was in the first wave of a political tide that in the years to come would turn the South into a largely Republican bastion.In 1964, he and four others became the first Republicans to be elected to Congress from Alabama since Reconstruction, in an election in which the partys presidential candidate, Senator Barry M. Goldwater, carried the state despite losing to President Lyndon B. Johnson in a landslide.While Republican candidates continued to make inroads elsewhere, however, their gains in Alabama were short-lived.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two years later, instead of a re-election bid, Mr. Martin ran for governor but was soundly defeated by a Democrat and fellow segregationist, Lurleen Wallace, a surrogate for her husband, George C.

A Refusal to Compromise? Civil War Historians Beg to Differ:::::Constitution as Compromise Photo The compromises over slavery began with the Constitution itself.It famously declared that slaves would count as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation and taxation.It also, in euphemistic language, allowed Congress to ban the international slave trade, but not for 20 years.And then there was the fact that the framers, deliberately, did not explicitly mention slavery even once.David Waldstreicher, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the author of Slaverys Constitution, said this approach created ambiguity about the framers intentions and the constitutionality of both proslavery and antislavery legislation.The Civil War was caused by the compromises in the Constitution over slavery, which shaped not only the evolution of slavery but also so many of the functions and dysfunctions of national politics, and still does, Mr. Waldstreicher said.It makes no sense to talk of a failure to compromise, except insofar as every war or political conflict is a failure to make a deal.The original compromises shaped everything.Battle Over Territorial Expansion Photo Most Northern states passed abolition laws by 1800, but the national debate intensified as factions fought over whether slavery would be allowed in the expanding western territories.In 1820, Congress enacted the Missouri Compromise, which allowed Missouri to enter the union as a slave state but otherwise forbade slavery above the 36th parallel, effectively drawing the lines for the sectional battle to follow.In 1836, it passed what would be the first of several gag rules, forbidding antislavery petitions from even being discussed.The Missouri Compromise unraveled with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which mandated that new states, regardless of geography, be allowed to decide the question of slavery by popular sovereignty.The act unleashed violence in Kansas, as well as in Congress itself, including an infamous brawl on the floor of the House in 1858 during debate over a proposed proslavery Kansas state constitution.That constitution was later defeated by a coalition of Republicans and Northern Democrats.Southern Democrats pushed so hard for such extremely proslavery policies, they drove Northern Democrats away from them, Kate Masur, a historian at Northwestern University, said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lincoln, the Great Compromiser?As slavery spread, so did the antislavery movement.Abolitionists then were often depicted as dangerous fanatics, but in truth the antislavery movement included many compromises when it came to black equality.One was the idea of colonization, which advocated resettling freed blacks in Africa, out a belief that they could never coexist with whites.One advocate of colonization was Abraham Lincoln, who indicated support for colonization as late as 1862.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even as a presidential nominee, he and the Republican Party were willing to entertain deals to keep the slaveholding South in the Union, including a proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow slavery to continue without federal interference where it already existed but prohibit its establishment in new territories.On that, it was the slaveholding states that refused to compromise, said Manisha Sinha, a historian at the University of Connecticut and the author of The Slaves Cause: A History of Abolition.Lincoln could have avoided the Civil War if he had agreed to compromise on the nonextension of slavery, but that was one thing Lincoln refused to compromise on, and rightly so, she said.When it comes to the Civil War, she added, we still cant seem to understand that the politics of compromise was a politics of appeasement that at many times sacrificed black freedom and rights.The Compromise of 1877 The 13th amendment, ratified in December 1865, eight months after the end of the Civil War, abolished slavery, but the battle over full citizenship for African-Americans continued during Reconstruction.There was widespread resistance to black male suffrage, which had been guaranteed by the 15th amendment.Tensions came to a climax with the deadlocked presidential election of 1876, when the results in Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana were disputed.The impasse ended with the Compromise of 1877, in which the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, was granted those states electoral votes in exchange for an end to federal support for republican governments in those states.Reconstruction was effectively over.Though the Compromise of 1877 is the one we remember, Ms. Masur, co-author of a recent National Park Service study of Reconstruction-related sites, noted that the way had been paved by earlier trade-offs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The election was as close as it was because Northerners had already compromised on the 15th amendment, she said.If there hadnt been voter suppression in the South from the outset of Reconstruction through the 1876 election itself, Hayes might well have won the presidency decisively.A Tragic Family Disagreement After Reconstruction was rolled back and Jim Crow segregation instituted in the South, a growing number of white Americans depicted the Civil War as a tragic family disagreement, rather than a battle over principle.In 1913, veterans from both sides gathered at Gettysburg for a Great Reunion, where President Woodrow Wilson gave an address that included no reference to slavery or secession.The era also saw a surge in the construction of Confederate monuments, including many outside the former Confederacy.Mr. Blight, the author of Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, said that Mr. Kellys remarks were themselves part of this reconciliationist tradition.It reflects a very old set of ideas about the meaning of the Civil War, Mr. Blight said.Everybody was right, and nobody was wrong.Everybody was noble, everyone fought for their conscience, you dont have to worry anymore about what they fought for.It takes all responsibility away, he said.Thats your compromise.

Republicans Delay Releasing Tax Bill, Signaling Trouble for Party:::::As Republicans rushed to lock down support from their members and key interest groups earlier on Tuesday, some new details of the bill began to trickle out.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told conservative groups on Tuesday afternoon that the draft bill would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent immediately, and not phase it in over a period of years, as had been discussed, according to a meeting attendee.Mr. Ryan also said that the plan would include a higher rate for the wealthiest earners, which would be above the 35 percent that Republicans have identified as their top tax rate in the framework released in September.He did not indicate whether the wealthiest would continue to pay the current top rate of 39.6 percent or if it would be higher or lower.Photo Attendees were also told by Mr. Ryan that Republicans would phase in a full repeal of the estate tax over several years.The House bill will include a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations profits, two people with knowledge of the drafting said, in an effort to prevent companies from shifting money abroad as the United States transitions to a so-called territorial tax system, which would subject only income earned domestically to the American corporate tax rate.The tax would be on all global income, and not on a country-by-country basis, as some companies had feared.Republican leaders also confirmed they would maintain a federal tax deduction for at least some state and local property taxes paid, while eliminating comparable deductions for income and sales taxes.Other issues remained in flux or unknown outside of a select group of lawmakers and congressional staff.Those include the size of an expanded child tax credit; whether to phase in or sunset some rate cuts; and the specifics of how the plan might affect tax-free retirement savings.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump invited nearly two dozen leaders of major business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation to the White House on Tuesday morning to discuss the bill.In the afternoon, Mr. Ryan met with Mr. Trump and then with more than a dozen conservative groups on the tax bill, including the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity.Each of those groups and in many cases, individual companies will be watching for how lawmakers change tax breaks large and small in their overhaul of the tax code.Business leaders, in particular, are ready to applaud or attack the bill depending on how those changes affect their bottom lines.Were trying to see, and evaluate with a calculator at the end of the day, are the incentives going to be right to help the economy to grow?said David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose industry has much at stake in the rewrite of the tax code.A Halloween-themed news release from Mr. Ryans office on Tuesday suggested that Republicans are prepared for many business groups to oppose the bill when it is released.The special interest ghouls will do anything to protect all their little tricks and treats, the release said.They will haunt the hallways and demonize our plan.They will conjure up new scare tactics and spread wicked tales.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Party leaders are already struggling to kill off some tax breaks they had targeted for elimination.Republicans had proposed wiping out the entire deduction for state and local taxes, which is particularly valuable to high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.After running into resistance from lawmakers, Mr. Brady said over the weekend that the coming tax plan would include an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens.In an interview on Tuesday with the radio host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Brady said the tax bill would not include a deduction for state or local income taxes.Our lawmakers in those high-tax states really believe their families are being punished the most by property taxes, Mr. Brady said, adding that those taxes are not based on your ability to pay theyre just painful.Mr. Brady also signaled the deduction for property taxes could be limited.Asked if there would be no cap on that deduction, Mr. Brady responded, To be determined.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday it was clear that the original plan to fully eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes was not going to occur.I think that shows a demonstration by our leadership and by the powers to be that we recognize that this issue needs to be resolved, Mr. Reed told reporters.He said that retaining a deduction for property taxes was gaining traction as we get to the finish line here.It did not appear on Tuesday that the compromise was sufficient to win over all the blue-state House Republicans who had raised concerns.Democrats criticized the compromise.Go figure that high property-tax states like Texas, Chairman Bradys state, would be better off under the proposal, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.Picking winners and losers like this doesnt solve the problem.The new state and local compromise is still a nearly trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class to pay for tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy.Mr. Trump pushed back on Democratic criticism in his meeting with business leaders.The Democrats will say our tax bill is for the rich, but they know its not, he said.He added, The Democrats want to raise taxes and really create obstruction, and the Republicans want to lower taxes, and we want to get rid of regulations.

Trump Can Pardon Manafort. He Shouldn’t.:::::Photo The indictments on Monday of the former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have some prominent conservatives openly considering desperate measures.The Wall Street Journal editorial board called on the special counsel whose investigation led to the indictments, Robert Mueller, to resign, arguing that he lacks the critical distance to carry out the inquiry.So did the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin.But the most radical suggestion came from two former Republican administration lawyers.To forestall a deepening crisis that could cripple the Trump White House, these lawyers, David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, urged the president to issue a blanket pardon to anyone involved with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.This isnt just a fringe possibility.A reporter raised the idea on Tuesday; Mr. Trump didnt answer the question.Though such a move would not violate the Constitution, it would provoke a political disaster.President Trump has tweeted that he has the complete power to pardon.As someone who supported the broadest reading of executive power as a deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, I think that Mr. Trump has the Constitution about right.Article II declares that the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.President Trump can clearly pardon anyone even himself subject to the Mueller investigation.But unless Mr. Trump wants to meet the same end as Richard Nixon, he should resort only to pardons that promote the central purpose of the power.As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 74, the Constitution creates a pardon power out of humanity and good policy to allow for mitigation from the rigor of the law.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So far, nothing in the Mueller inquiry cries out for considerations of mercy.Far from it.If the facts of the indictment are to be believed, Mr. Manafort and his associate wove a dark web of shell companies and foreign bank accounts to launder millions of dollars and avoid taxes on unreported income paid by Ukraine, its former president and its pro-Russia political party.The president tweeted on Monday that this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.Thats true.But the very absence of a link to Mr. Manaforts performance as Trump campaign chairman underscores the fact that Mr. Mueller has not brought the charges out of political bias.
Manafort Is the Tip of the Iceberg:::::Theres nothing illegal or immoral about that.But to prevent people from sheltering that income from United States tax, the Internal Revenue Code requires owners of those companies to report that income on their tax returns.According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates did not.Instead of those companies sending funds to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to go buy things, the companies did the buying on their behalf all kinds of luxury consumer goods and, even better, in Mr. Manaforts case, millions of dollars of real estate.Not surprisingly, the Internal Revenue Code would also require Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to declare the value of these goods, services and investments as income.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.But again, they didnt.The real issue here isnt what the I.R.S.says is income.The real issue is how that code is enforced.And this is where things really break down.There are a few ways that United States law seeks to make taxpayers declare company income in foreign bank accounts.This is where the indictment implicates both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and these techniques.First, United States anti-money laundering laws require that citizens file a form, a Foreign Bank and Financials Account report, if they control (including through a company or other legal entity) foreign bank account worth over a total of $10,000.Next, income tax Form 1040, Schedule B, Part III also requires taxpayers to check a box if they held a foreign account.According to the indictment, neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Gates did so.In other words, they refused to rat themselves out to the I.R.S.that they were engaging in tax evasion.What a surprise.In addition, the United States has embarked on a policy in which it has enlisted (at the tip of a metaphorical bayonet) foreign banks to report to the United States government when its taxpayers control an account.However, the Manafort-Gates duo was allegedly careful to hide their control of their corporations and partnerships by having so-called nominee owners (the actual owner nominates someone else as owner).Presumably, they failed to inform those banks that they were the actual owners.In other words, once again, they refused to rat themselves out.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Of course, failure to file those forms or check those boxes is a crime in itself and punishable with a penalty.But its hard to imagine that additional penalties would sway the committed tax evader.It is, however, easy to see how honest people can be punished if they unintentionally fail to file forms or check boxes, exposing them to investigations and penalties that were never meant to apply to them.Fortunately, there is a better way.Both United States law and global anti-money laundering standards require banks to report suspicious activity to government law enforcement agencies.Millions of dollars paid by dodgy Ukrainians to unknown companies in Cyprus and then to luxury car dealers in the United States for no known legal reason would certainly seem to qualify.These enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened, and vastly so.In the cases of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and no doubt many others with millions tucked away in offshore banks, they did not result in the absence of a special counsel in an investigation of years of possible crimes, or an indictment.Relying on self-reporting by those who are committing tax evasion is a fools errand.
To Protect U.S. Solar Manufacturing, Trade Body Recommends Limits on Imports:::::Two companies, Suniva and SolarWorld, brought a solar case to the trade commission earlier this year, contending they were forced into bankruptcy as a result of a flood of subsidized imports from China.The companies said imports of photovoltaic cells and modules that are ultimately made into solar panels had driven them and other American companies out of business.Suniva called the International Trade Commissions recommendations disappointing in a statement, saying they were not strict enough.It called on Mr. Trump to implement more stringent restrictions necessary to save American manufacturing.The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group that has fought any tariffs or barriers to imports, said in a statement Tuesday that the commissioners had taken a thoughtful approach and did not recommend anything close to what the petitioners asked for.But it emphasized that proposed tariffs would be intensely harmful to the industry.The case is unique because it relies on a rarely used section of federal trade law, known as Section 201 or a global safeguard investigation, which gives the president broad authority to impose tariffs or other restrictions to help protect a domestic industry.The prospect of such restrictions has set off a fierce backlash from industries and users of solar power, who argue that such measures would raise prices throughout the supply chain and ultimately cost more American jobs than they would save.They argue that cheaper solar products from China have actually been a boon to their businesses and accelerated the adoption of solar energy in the United States, where it now powers millions of American homes and businesses.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Workers who install solar power projects, utilities who purchase the power and major commercial users of solar power, like retailers, could all be damaged by such restrictions, said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the Energy Trade Action Coalition, which represents those groups.You can play with the numbers and tweak things, but the bottom line is its going to put those groups at risk, Mr. Maisano said.The case will also be a test of the presidents willingness to impose the kind of powerful trade barriers that he has frequently threatened.Mr. Trump repeatedly talked on the campaign trail about imposing sweeping tariffs on products from China, Mexico and elsewhere, a tough stance that spurred political support among Americans frustrated with the economy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But since Mr. Trump came into office, powerful business lobbies have pushed back on that tough approach, arguing that tariffs benefit a narrow slice of industry at the expense of other companies and consumers of those products, who have to pay higher costs.Other proposed trade policies involving tariffs, including measures on imported steel and aluminum, appear to have stalled under such pressure.The recommendations announced by the four members of the International Trade Commission ranged significantly in the impact they would have on the industry.The most moderate proposal, made by commissioner Meredith M. Broadbent, would restrict imports of cells, modules and other photovoltaic products to 8.9 gigawatts in the first year a level she said was consistent with the level of imports in 2016.That level would increase by 1.4 gigawatts each subsequent year, effectively preventing a surge in imports, but not significantly altering the current market.Ms. Broadbent also recommended auctioning licenses to import these products, and reinvesting the resulting funds in the domestic solar industry.The other three commissioners made far more stringent recommendations.David S. Johanson, vice chairman of the International Trade Commission, and Irving A. Williamson, a commissioner, jointly recommended a 30 percent tariff on imports of solar cells in excess of 1 gigawatt, as well as a 30 percent tariff on modules.Each penalty would be gradually lowered in the next few years.Rhonda K. Schmidtlein, the commissions chair, recommended a tariff of 10 percent on the first 0.5 gigawatts of cells imported, and a 30 percent tariff on cells exceeding that volume.She also recommended a 35 percent tariff on modules.The barriers would be gradually reduced over the next four years.
Trump’s Trade Endgame Could Be the Undoing of Global Rules:::::According to a trade diplomat who is aware of the goings-on, American negotiators have warned Mexicans and Canadians that if the United States leaves Nafta, they shouldnt expect trade relations to simply snap back to W.T.O.rules, which include a tariff ceiling of 3.5 percent, on average, for Mexican exports to the United States and 7.1 percent for American exports to Mexico.The United States, they argue, wont be bound by these constraints.Asked for comment, Mr. Lighthizers office referred me to a statement from June in which he affirmed his commitment to working closely with U.S. trading partners to increase the W.T.O.s ability to promote free and fair trade.But he has not been shy about expressing his gripes about the organization.Meanwhile, the United States has been chipping away at its judicial apparatus, blocking appointments to the seven-member appellate body that rules on trade disputes.The court is now two members short and will be down three when the European jurist steps down in December.The impasse prompted Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Unions top trade diplomat, to warn that the American position risks killing the W.T.O.from the inside.Battling the Deficits The United States runs trade deficits with most of the worlds largest economies.The Trump administration argues this is unfair.U.S. bilateral trade balances for trade in goods, 2016 BILLIONS 20 LARGEST COUNTRIES China $347.0 Japan 68.8 Germany 64.7 Mexico 64.4 Italy 28.6 Korea 27.6 India 24.4 France 15.6 Switzerland 13.6 Indonesia 13.2 11.0 Canada Russia 8.7 3.0 Spain SURPLUS Britain + 1.0 Saudi Arabia + 1.1 Turkey + 1.3 Argentina + 3.9 Brazil + 4.1 Australia + 12.7 Netherlands + 23.6 While emasculating the trade organization may seem foolhardy, trade experts warn that blowing up international trade law may be the only way the Trump administration could pursue its quixotic goal of eliminating the bilateral trade deficits that it has with most countries.And that presents the world with a sort of Catch-22.The American current account deficit a broad measure of its trade is the mirror image of the gap between the United States national savings and its national investment.Because it invests more than it saves, it draws money from abroad and spends it on foreign goods and services.Until it closes the savings gap, no amount of diplomacy, bullying or cajoling will close the gap in trade.If the United States leaves Nafta, its possible that its deficit with Mexico will balloon rather than shrink, as uncertainty sends the peso into a tailspin and makes Mexican exports cheaper.But even if Mr. Trumps Nafta gambit worked and bilateral trade came into balance, it wouldnt necessarily change the balance of American trade over all.Mr. Lighthizer might remember that after Canada, Japan and the European Community agreed in the early 1980s to voluntary restraint agreements limiting exports of steel to the United States, producers in countries like South Korea and South Africa simply picked up the slack.As another Dartmouth economist, Robert Staiger, told me, unless the American savings-investment imbalance corrected itself, too, the former deficit with Mexico would simply pop up somewhere else.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bilateral deficits are going to keep popping up everywhere, he said.Trump is going to be playing Whac-a-Mole.And if Republicans pass their smorgasbord of tax cuts, the mushrooming budget deficit will push the savings-investment imbalance in exactly the wrong direction.The problem for the rest of the world is that any of these situations is likely to produce great frustration in an administration that appears to believe trade balances are negotiated like real estate deals.They all put the United States on a collision course with the legal regime administered by the W.T.O.Photo It is unclear whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to pull the United States out of the trade regime governed by W.T.O., or even out of Nafta.Rufus Yerxa, a former top American trade diplomat on the team that negotiated both Nafta and the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks that led to the creation of the W.T.O.in 1995, argues that whatever the legalities, the thought that Mr. Trump may pull the United States out of the trade organization is not credible.The losses, he said, would be far too steep.Countries would discriminate at will against American products and services.Everybody in the world could do anything they wanted to do to us, Mr. Yerxa said.The sprawling supply chains that American companies have laid out across the world since the trade organization came into being would be under threat.Chad P. Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed.It would hurt economic activity much more than in the 1980s, he said.So much trade back then was in final goods.Now a lot is in intermediate parts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It was easy to bully Japan in the 1980s.Its security depended on the United States.Its unlikely that Washington could pull off the same thing with China today.Though the W.T.O.would suffer a blow if the United States left, it might survive it.Today the United States accounts for only about 13 percent of world trade, down from almost a quarter in the 1980s.Whats most mystifying to foreign diplomats and trade policy experts is how the Trump administration conceives the endgame of bringing down a legal system the United States spent so much time and effort to build.Even if Mr. Trump prevails, the United States stands to lose.American sugar policy comes to mind.In the early 1980s, hoping to put a floor on prices in the United States, the government set up a quota system to limit sugar imports.As Professor Irwin tells it, the enterprise proved more difficult than the experts in Washington ever thought.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The American import quota got smaller and smaller to keep pace with falling prices worldwide.At one point, American sugar was so expensive that companies started importing sugary products like cake mix, iced tea and cocoa in bulk to extract and sell the sugar within.Coke and Pepsi switched from sugar to corn syrup, slashing domestic demand and forcing the Agriculture Department to reduce import quotas further.And candy makers moved abroad, to where sugar was cheaper.In the Caribbean and Central America, sugar quotas led farmers to stop producing sugar and start cultivating illegal narcotics that were smuggled into the United States.To cap it all, in August 1986 the United States sold China 136,000 tons of sugar it had accumulated in its efforts to bolster the price.It was sugar it bought at 18 cents a pound.It sold at 5 cents.Within days, world sugar prices plummeted.Robert Lighthizer has been involved in international trade diplomacy long enough to remember this kind of go-it-alone trade strategy.He doesnt appear to have learned the lessons history has taught us since then.
Tax Bill Delay Gives Republicans More Time to Wrestle With Key Details:::::Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions Lawmakers are still considering changes to the amount of pretax income that workers can set aside in their 401(k) retirement accounts.Currently, workers under 50 can save up to $18,000 a year without having to pay taxes up front.House Republicans are discussing changing the rules so workers are encouraged to put more money into retirement accounts that are taxed upfront, like Roth I.R.A.s, rather than on the back end.This creates both practical and political problems.Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions would save only a sliver of the $1.5 trillion in lost revenue from the tax cuts that Republicans are pushing.What is more, such plans are widely used by middle-class taxpayers that Republicans say they are trying to help.Raising income taxes on the rich The tax framework released by the so-called big six Republican tax working group last month the six lead negotiators from the House, Senate and Trump administration called for three tax brackets with a top rate of 35 percent, down from 39.6 percent today.The plan kept open the option of creating an additional tax bracket for top earners to ensure the tax code remained progressive.No guidance was given on what that tax rate would be or what income level it would affect.Lawmakers have agreed to a higher rate for the wealthiest Americans, though the exact rate and the income levels it will affect, are still under discussion.Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the partys brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend.Yet they may have no choice: Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this week that she opposed lowering the top tax rate for individuals earning more than $1 million, creating pressure for Republicans to include a higher bracket in order to win passage.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making some cuts temporary or gradual Republican lawmakers are selling their plan as a middle-class tax cut, and the bill is expected to create three income tax brackets 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent and call for doubling the standard deduction.Yet lawmakers are considering making these changes temporary, so they would expire after 10 years.The conventional wisdom is that a future Congress will vote to continue the cuts and not allow them to expire.But thats a tricky assumption given their cost, which will only exacerbate a federal deficit already on an upward trajectory.The Treasury Department said the deficit for the fiscal year 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion.Federal debt, which has already topped $20 trillion, is expected to grow by an additional $10 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Compounding the math problem is that the plan would probably make the corporate tax cuts permanent.Lawmakers argue that a permanent cut, to 20 percent from todays 35 percent rate, is needed to trigger the economic growth they anticipate, and they say it will ultimately put more money into workers pockets.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, those corporate tax cuts are expected to cost $2 trillion over the next decade and, to help make the budget work, lawmakers are discussing phasing in the corporate tax cut over several years to get to the 20 percent rate.The White House on Monday seemed to suggest that was a nonstarter.Limiting the estate tax The original framework called for repealing the estate tax, which would reduce federal revenues by $239 billion over a decade.Estates are taxed at a rate of 40 percent, but the first $5.49 million of an inheritance is exempt from taxation.Couples can leave their heirs as much as $11 million, none of it taxed, meaning only a few thousand wealthy estates are subject to the tax each year.President Trump has talked about the estate tax as a punishment for farmers and small businesses, but his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has acknowledged that getting rid of it would disproportionately help rich people.That has turned into a key talking point for Democrats, who are already working to kill the bill in the hopes that they can find a way to a bipartisan tax plan.Republican Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said on Tuesday that lawmakers would phase in a full repeal of the estate tax over several years, an accounting maneuver aimed at helping the budget math work for the tax plan.
Tech Executives Are Contrite About Election Meddling, but Make Few Promises on Capitol Hill:::::Since then, the company has scrambled to appease lawmakers by promising to hire more than 1,000 people to manually review political ad purchases and to make public the funding behind those ads.Video The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible, Colin Stretch, Facebooks general counsel, told senators.The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us and one that we are determined to meet, said Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.At the heart of the companies problems are business models that reward viral content which can include misinformation and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday.In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr.Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, Mr. Kennedy said.The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month.Every minute.Probably every second.You dont have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?Photo Mr.Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries.Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow, Mr. Graham said.What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.Facebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television.In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.Our midterms are 370 days away, and we dont have time to mess around with dialogue anymore, Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing.Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlins agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last years election.Photo Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States, said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.That assertion was at odds with the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump, going beyond just posting disruptive content on social media.Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clintons campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Graham asked Mr.Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trumps candidacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton, Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr.Stretch.After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trumps legitimacy.Is that what you saw on Facebook?Mr.Stretch agreed.But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr.Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.Photo In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?Mr. Franken said.But Mr.Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.The reason Im hesitating on foreign currency is its relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies, Mr.Stretch said.So its a signal, but not enough.That response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better, Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged.In addition to Facebooks admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform.Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.Tuesdays hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.I like that they are contrite, but these issues are existential and they arent taking any structural changes, said Tim Wu, a professor of law at Columbia University.These are Band-Aids.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated:::::The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load.This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradleys alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment.This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelors degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin.The typical community college student isnt a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees.Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree a good result, but one that wasnt counted for graduation rates.So, following the committees lead, education officials made several changes.They included part-time and returning students in the calculation.They extended the time period to eight years.And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success.The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008.Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years.North Shore Community College was typical its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes.In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions community colleges have a graduation rate of 20%.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students.Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine.Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shores graduation rate to 35 percent.Another 19 percent transferred before graduation.Others were still working toward a degree.All told, more than half of Mr. Burtons students had a successful outcome not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy.The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment.Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions.Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures.And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere.Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward.The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic.Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college.In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined.The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate.But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional.What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent.Add in transfers?8.1 percent.Include those still enrolled?8.5 percent.Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures.Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges.Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate.But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better.San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years.Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent.Most students at San Jose City College are falling short.Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when

How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You:::::If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, whats all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set.Todays stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas.But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate what people generally mean when they use this term would use market signals to set stipend levels.Photo Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program, said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options.That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce the financial burden on future generations.Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables.One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries own money they need to contribute.The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time.Both aspects are hotly debated.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage.In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy.A lot rides on how the governments support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare, said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis.Geography also plays a role.If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established.Across the variations the C.B.O.examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent.But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare.Under one projection, the C.B.O.estimates, traditional Medicares premium could double.In all the scenarios the C.B.O.analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services.Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O.estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less.In either case, people would have access to plans that dont cost more than todays.But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket.Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts.Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency, said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live.In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid.In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, theres a fundamental lesson: Its conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but its very hard to do so in a way that doesnt increase costs for at least some consumers.To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for.Thats much harder.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trump’s Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices:::::It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option.The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible.There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider.If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov.But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company.A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice.Thats because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan.Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the presidents actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year.The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for whats happening with the entire health insurance market.But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types arent rising as fast.Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent.Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well.The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did.In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov.The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who dont smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages.Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats:::::Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats dont have a candidate who raised $100,000.On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree.In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment.20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts.And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years.They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maines Second, New Yorks 21st and Illinoiss 12th.Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that werent bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryans district in Wisconsin, Kentuckys Sixth or Kansas Second.And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.Photo The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York.Theyve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen.If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race.But theres a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the partys general election chances.Theres a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct.whites with a degree Number of Dems over $100k The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm.In these areas, theres no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to do something about Mr. Trumps presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Womens March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgias Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers.The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas.There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in Californias typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.The good news for Democrats is that they dont need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if its a so-called wave election year.Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the G.O.P.starts from a position of strength: The Democrats path to a House majority is much more challenging than it was in 2006, or than it was for the Republicans in 2010.They cant afford to leave many districts like New Yorks 24th or Californias 21st off the board.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Mexico’s Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making:::::It makes me desperate, he said, shaking his head at his countrys missteps, because this violence, its increasing.Extreme Measures Photo In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade.A new cartel, La Familia Michoacna, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence.Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.That same year, Felipe Caldern won the presidency by a hair.Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Caldern left him without a strong mandate.Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.Critics say Mr. Caldern sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.Defenders say he had little alternative.Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption.When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges.Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people.But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems Photo Mr. Caldern adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders.This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexicos pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5

officers from conducting investigations drifted.As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion.Predatory crimes spiked.Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.In the process of that fragmentation, we didnt do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces, said Mr. Valds, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding.So we have the worst of the worst.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Key Point of Failure Photo The solution to the problem would seem obvious.Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.Instead, disorder and violence have risen.Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the countrys woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership.Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.Democracy, as intended, undercut the partys once all-encompassing power.But the old system built around the assumption of a strong central authority remains in place.This has weakened the state while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a nightmare scenario in which the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms.And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants often providing the wrong kind of incentives.At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability, Mr. Hope said.That is the key point of failure in Mexico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work, he added.Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement.Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services.Nothing happens.A Frail State Recedes Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary in the press, Mr. Lagunes said.But, he added, Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable.In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded.Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderns drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses.But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.State and Society Atomize This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Caldern did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers.But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed self-defense militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced.Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping.Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism represent a disempowerment of the state.Paralysis Amid Disaster Photo Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous.Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there, said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan.Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the countrys social decomposition.Mr. Valds, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police, he said.We spent years trying to convince the political class.But he found those institutions dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.Whats happening in Guadalupe is whats happening in all of Mexico, Mr. Torjes said.There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.
Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked:::::Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as disputed.But how effective are these measures?To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions.But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts.Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebooks interventions.Yales Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings.First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon.False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before.This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline disputed.We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting peoples beliefs.Photo In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of disputed labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate an implied truth effect.If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct there are far too many for humans to check everything).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style disputed banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed.The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as somewhat or very accurate in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook disputed banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition.It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is rated false.(We find no evidence of a large implied truth effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)Other results suggest further reason for caution.Back in April, Facebook provided users with Tips to Spot False News in an article that was linked above users news feeds.We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive.When we showed a warning reminding users to remain skeptical and think critically to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false.Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered.(A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)
A Big Test of Police Body Cameras Defies Expectations:::::After the public uprising in response to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., advocates and many police officials turned to cameras as a way to reduce violent encounters and build trust.By 2015, 95 percent of large police departments reported they were using body cameras or had committed to doing so in the near future, according to a national survey.Photo The cameras provide an independent, if sometimes ambiguous, record of police-civilian encounters.Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect.That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts.Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras.The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.The Rialto study had a big impact in policing.Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website.A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras.(Results are due out this spring.)But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington.Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video.The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date, said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues.It was not directly involved in the research.The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more.The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost.In Washington, M.P.D.officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day.About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.Video The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations.In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place.Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures, Mr. Yu said.In cities that have weaker policies, its certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.Like other advocacy groups, the American Civil Liberties Union has supported body cameras.But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U.of D.C., should give us pause.For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras.But they admit to being surprised by the findings.I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave, said the M.P.D.chief, Peter Newsham.Why didnt the cameras change behavior?After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior.Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages.Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations and not elsewhere.One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them.But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new.(The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.)Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context.The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters.When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior, said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.Photo Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems.After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the citys police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here, Chief Newsham said.Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory.(The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.To Chief Newsham, the cameras primary benefit is to improve relations with the community.The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I dont think you can undervalue that, he said.So far, its hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said hed like to find out more through additional studies like this one.The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).We like to be very anecdotal in policing to compare this year to that year, said M.P.D.Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers.This study is a whole other thing.An updated version of this article, with more about the national implications of the Washington, D.C., study of police body cameras, can be found here.
The Fed Claims to Be Independent. That’s Mostly a Myth.:::::Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul.Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both.Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest.If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame.If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it.Using legislative records to document lawmakers attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank.Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed.1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear.When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone.For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspans Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates.When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization.Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules.Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations.Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy.Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the president will revise the Federal Reserve Act.Photo Critics in Congress take aim at both monetary goals and tools.In July, the House financial services chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned Ms. Yellen that the Fed should cease and desist from buying assets that venture into fiscal policy: If we are not careful, we may wake up one day to find our central bankers have instead become our central planners.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Feds 2012 adoption of an inflation target also belies any notion of Fed independence.Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, first broached the subject with his colleagues a decade earlier.Fed transcripts reveal acute sensitivity to securing congressional support.As Donald Kohn, then the Fed vice chairman, argued in 2008, having an inflation target wont have any effect if it is repudiated by the Congress.In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, the perceived political risk of setting a target again deterred Fed action.The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis.Even today, when former Fed officials recommend a higher inflation goal to generate greater growth, G.O.P.lawmakers direct Ms. Yellen not to change the target.Perhaps the Fed would be less eager to raise interest rates again if it could independently raise the inflation bar instead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernankes crisis prescriptions.At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis.Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.Political interdependence cautions against such certainty.Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernankes unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats.And President Trumps rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Feds financial crisis response.A new Fed, backed by an expanding economy, may temporarily quiet the legislative critics.But whether in this presidential term or some later one, an inevitable economic slowdown or a more serious financial panic will surely restart the cycle of crisis, blame and reform.
Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019:::::It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacares rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments.The draft bill would make the application process for such state innovation waivers easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with comparable affordability to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov.The Trump administration had slashed the budget for both programs in August.It does not include one of the industrys biggest requests: funding that would protect insurers from high costs associated with very expensive patients.Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums.But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves.Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, Americas Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill.But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market.Weve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable, said Joseph R.

Democrats Think Men Have It Easier. Republicans Disagree.:::::Ninety-six percent of respondents say gender equality is important, but they disagree on whether it has been achieved.Half say the country hasnt gone far enough in giving women equal rights, about 40 percent say it has been about right, and 10 percent say it has gone too far.A Partisan Divide on the Benefits of Changing Gender Roles Changing gender roles have made it easier for: REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree Republicans Democrats Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree There really is no consensus among the public about whether changing roles have made things better or easier for families or for men and women, said Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research at Pew and an author of the report.Although there are small gender gaps, the partisan divide drives the differences in responses, she said.Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say changing gender roles had improved peoples lives.College graduates were also more likely than those without college degrees to say that changing gender roles were a good thing, and that more needed to be done.Of college graduates, 69 percent said men had it easier, compared with 27 percent of those with a high school education or less who said so.Seventy-one percent of college graduates said changing gender roles had given women more satisfying lives, compared with 49 percent of those without college degrees.Views about gender equality reflected experiences with gender discrimination, particularly at work.Women, Democrats and college graduates were much more likely to say they were discriminated against because of their gender, and more likely to think gender equality had not gone far enough.Male privilege allows men to be free to move about in public without threat of harassment, a woman, 54, told Pew, which published responses anonymously.When they speak, they are assumed to have some authority without having to prove it.They still earn more money than women.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Republican men were more likely than Democratic men to say they had experienced discrimination.And while only 10 percent of the public said the country had gone too far toward gender equality, 23 percent of men who said they experienced discrimination said so.The largest shares of both men and women who said they experienced gender discrimination said it came in hiring, pay or promotions.Ten percent of women said they had experienced harassment or catcalling.People who say women have it easier these days say women get preferential treatment in job opportunities, and those who think men have it easier say they have better pay and job opportunities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When asked how women have it easier, one respondent, a 53-year-old man, said, Lower standards for the same positions in order to get more women for those positions.Another man, 46, said: Everyone is on the prowl for perceived injustice and attempts to elevate women of all ages.Not so much for males.Explaining why men have it easier, a 29-year-old man said, You simply need to look at the percentages of male C.E.O.s and relative salaries to see there is likely a systematic advantage to being male.Women have benefited more than men from being employed and from having men doing more at home, respondents said.But even for women, fewer than half of respondents said changing gender roles had benefited them outside work.This might be because even though most women work and men do more at home, women still shoulder the bulk of the family responsibilities.When asked how its easier to be a man, one respondent, a woman, 65, said: Because most of them dont have to work outside the home and take care of the children and everything else a woman normally does.A womans work is never done.
Google’s Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance.:::::The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own.In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together.Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, its easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as youre redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.Photo The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially.The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic.And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.Theres no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city building.Its hard to move fast and break things in government, and public funds dont allow for the failure rates that venture capital does.New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later.But you cant do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theres also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable.They resist omniscient engineering.And past efforts at doing that whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias have invariably failed for that reason.Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it.Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we havent developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply.Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem we havent developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms.The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley.Its staffed by both technologists and government alums.Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types.And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.Photo We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction, Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started.Good friction is serendipity, its opportunity, its diversity, its seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning.Bad friction is congestion, its pollution.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technologists temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction.And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics.In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop thats still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.Because its looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developers parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks.But there would be no point in doing all that if there werent thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto.(Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.
Trump resists mounting pressure from Bannon and others to fight Mueller:::::Former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon called congressional Republicans church mice for what he sees as their timid response to the Mueller investigation.(Mary F. Calvert/Reuters) Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges against three former Trump campaign officials.Despite his growing frustration with a federal probe he has roundly dismissed, Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly, at the urging of his attorneys inside and outside the White House.But several prominent Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have said they think the presidents posture is too timid.Seeing the investigation as a political threat, they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its funding.Still, Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller, a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under consideration.Bannon in recent days has spoken with Trump by phone to relay his concerns about the presidents position and to counsel a shift in strategy, according to three people with knowledge of the conversation.The president so far has not accepted Bannons advice, these people said.President Trump has been cooperating with the Mueller probe, on the advice of lawyers inside and outside the White House.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Bannons view has been amplified elsewhere on the right, with talk radio and cable news commentators speaking out more forcefully against Mueller and his expanding probe.The Wall Street Journal editorial board has called on Mueller to resign.The Journal is part of News Corp., which is led by Rupert Murdoch, a friend of Trump who speaks privately with the president.But many people in Trumps orbit recommend that he stay the course with cooperation encouraging him to harshly criticize media coverage of the investigation but avoid engaging Mueller.I like Steve, but his advice is not always the most helpful, said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of Newsmax, a conservative media outlet.In this case, whatever Steve says, the president should do the opposite.[Three former Trump campaign officials charged by special counsel] The tensions extend to Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers have mostly split into two camps: those who are wary of weighing in on Muellers investigation and those who see it as a prime political target.Bannon is demanding that GOP leaders move swiftly to end congressional probes into Russian interference, undermine Muellers investigation and increase scrutiny on Democratic controversies.The Republicans are like church mice, Bannon said Tuesday.No support of the president.Totally gutless.The Hill needs to step up.Senators from both parties on Oct. 31 commented on the charges against three former Trump campaign officials unveiled the day before in special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs probe.(Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post) Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes that Republicans should proceed carefully, and he called Mueller a very ethical person.I dont know how you could improve things by interfering, Grassley said.The process just ought to go.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a trusted Trump ally, has launched an investigation into an Obama-era uranium deal and is preparing to invite witnesses this week to testify about the FBIs handling of Russia investigations.Nunes intends to issue subpoenas if people decline to appear, according to people briefed on his plans.Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser who praised Mueller earlier this year after his appointment as special counsel, said he has slowly soured on the former FBI director and agrees that Congress should put a harsher national spotlight on him.Mueller ought to be held accountable, Gingrich said.He ticked through a series of what he considers questionable moves by Mueller and his team, including their handling of former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, whom the government described in an indictment unsealed Monday as a proactive cooperator.Congress should look seriously at whether Mueller put a wire on this guy and sent him around to entrap people, Gingrich said.If that happened, Congress better see the full transcripts, not just the FBIs edited versions.Congress should also ask why theyre raiding [former campaign chairman Paul] Manaforts home at 5 a.m. for a white-collar crime from a few years ago.This sentiment is not heard at the White House, however, where officials have been careful not to antagonize the special counsel.Our approach has been to be cooperative and responsive and to see this come to a quick conclusion, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Have we been aggressive in our comments and our feelings towards the Clinton campaign and the DNC?Yes.But thats where our aggression is seen and nowhere else.Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing Russia matters, said after Mondays indictments of Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, Nothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special counsel, with whom we continue to cooperate.Cobb added, There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating Mueller.Republicans in Congress said Trump is wise to avoid messing with Mueller.There would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).Regardless of which side of the aisle.Thats just beyond the pale.[Upstairs at home, with the TV on, Trump fumes over Russia indictments] Among Republicans, there is broad agreement to bring attention to past controversies involving Hillary Clinton, Trumps Democratic opponent in the 2016 election, that have animated hourly discussions on Fox News Channel and conservative talk radio programs.The White House and allies have waged a public relations battle over the Clinton campaigns and the Democratic National Committees funding of research that resulted in the famous dossier that details Trumps alleged connections to Russia.The dossier has become a lightning rod, with congressional Republican leaders trying to discredit Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier, and the documents author, Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the U.S. intelligence community.Republicans also are trying to bring scrutiny to a 2010 uranium deal approved by the Obama administration, while Clinton was secretary of state.The deal which Trump used as a political cudgel against Clinton during the campaign allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity, although the company cannot export uranium.Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, a Trump confidant, decried the lack of investigative attention on Clinton, a point the president and his top aides have made in recent days.This is not hyperbole, Hannity said Monday night in his on-air monologue, which the president is known to watch regularly.I am not overstating the case.We are at a major crisis point in America tonight.Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today?Some Republican lawmakers have heeded these calls.House and Senate GOP leaders have announced two investigations into the uranium deal, while at least three congressional committees are continuing to look into how the FBI handled Clintons email scandal.But there appears to be little appetite for legislation that would cut Muellers funding or otherwise limit the scope of his investigation, something various Trump allies have suggested is necessary.My basic philosophy is, once you have an independent counsel, you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts, said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding.If somebodys doing a job, you dont want to cut it off.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said: The idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained, or be otherwise restricted, is really out there.I think thats extremely unlikely.Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.
Trump was expressing political opinion by calling sexual-harassment accusers ‘liars,’ his attorneys argue:::::Summer Zervos, right, listens alongside her attorney Gloria Allred during a news conference in Los Angeles in October 2016.(Ringo H.W.Chiu/AP) President Trumps lawyers argued in a new court filing late Tuesday that he was expressing a political opinion last year when he called accusations of sexual misconduct against him as false and the accusers liars, seeking to dismiss a defamation complaint by a woman who said he groped her.Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trumps reality television show The Apprentice and now a California restaurant owner, filed her lawsuit against Trump in January, three days before his inauguration.In October 2016, Zervos accused Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting that took place when she was seeking a job at his company.Her lawsuit claims that he made defamatory statements by describing as liars women who came forward last year to accuse him of misconduct.Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for Trump, said in a statement that there is no merit to her case, adding that it is based on allegations of events that never occurred.He described it as nothing more than a politically-motivated lawsuit stemming from accusations made in a news conference weeks before the presidential election.In the new 36-page legal filing, Trumps attorneys argue that previous legal cases have established wide latitude for political speech, and that Trumps comments were effectively campaign rhetoric, coming in the context of the heated 2016 presidential campaign.All of the Statements occurred on political forums a campaign website, on Mr. Trumps Twitter account, in a presidential debate, and at campaign rallies where the listeners expect to hear public debate, taken as political opinion rather than a defamatory statement, they argued.A New York State Supreme Court judge is considering Trumps motion to have the case thrown out.Zervos is one of 11 women who spoke out during the 2016 campaign and accused Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, of unwanted touching or kissing.Trump denied the allegations, calling them pure fiction and labeling the women horrible, horrible liars.He vowed to sue his accusers and promised evidence that would refute their claims, although nearly a year later, neither the lawsuits nor such evidence has materialized.[My pain is everyday: After Weinsteins fall, Trump accusers wonder: Why not him?]Trump, asked about the Zervos case last month, called it made-up stuff and disgraceful.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last week that the Trump administrations official position is that all of Trumps accusers are lying.Through her attorney Gloria Allred, Zervos has declined interview requests; Allred said Zervos does not plan to give media interviews during the litigation process.As part of the case, Zervoss attorneys have sought to subpoena documents from Trumps campaign related to any of the women who have accused him of inappropriate sexual contact.The subpoena remains on hold while Trumps lawyers seek to have the case dismissed.His attorneys previously argued that a sitting U.S. president cannot be sued in state court.[In Apprentice defamation case, Trump will argue he is immune from lawsuits in state courts until he leaves office] In their new filing, Trumps lawyers cited a New York State Supreme Court judges ruling in January dismissing a defamation complaint by Cheryl Jacobus, a political strategist and television commentator who claimed that Trump defamed her by insulting her on Twitter.That judge found that his statements were not defamatory.The presidents lawyers argued that Trump had a First Amendment right to call the claims by Zervos and other women false.They said that by accusing him of sexual misconduct to the media, Zervos was explicitly soliciting Trump to engage in the debate in an effort to affect the election.This is a politically-driven action, brought against a sitting President for exercising his First Amendment right to speak on political and public matters concerning, among other things, his own qualifications for President, the medias role in the election process, and the tactics of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, his attorneys argued.Trumps attorneys also said that he did not specifically call Zervos a liar.Here, Mr. Trump was merely defending his character and qualifications for office from the false attacks Ms. Zervos leveled against him just a few weeks before the Presidential election, they argued.Trumps attorneys again asked for the dismissal of Zervoss suit, or a stay in the case while Trump is president, saying the claim is a civil action unrelated to his official duties as president.The closely watched lawsuit is unfolding amid heightened public scrutiny of allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men.Trumps accusers complaints were made public during the 2016 campaign following the emergence of an Access Hollywood video that captured Trump bragging in graphic terms about kissing women and grabbing them by the genitals.Jenna Johnson contributed to this report.
For Trump, October's two mass killings in New York and Las Vegas lead to very different responses:::::A candlelight vigil on the Las Vegas Strip following a mass shooting in October.(Chris Wattie/Reuters) This article has been updated.October was bookended by tragedy.On Halloween, a man who authorities say emigrated from Uzbekistan seven years ago, drove a rented pickup truck down a bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot and subdued.On Oct. 1, a man shooting from the windows of a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip killed 58 and wounded 546.It would not be surprising for reactions to those events from a president to vary.The Vegas incident was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, killing seven times as many people.But the difference in reactions from President Trump reflects his perceptions of the sorts of threat each perpetrator represents, not the actual damage done.A man deliberately drove a vehicle onto a bike path in Lower Manhattan on Oct. 31, killing at least eight people and injuring 11.Here is what we know.(Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) Immediately after the Vegas shooting, Trump offered one thought on Twitter.My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting.God bless you!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2017 Several days later, he visited the city, offering his support for first responders and those who had been wounded by the spray of bullets.WE LOVE YOU LAS VEGAS!pic.twitter.com/nxRWeR1gEz Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017 Stephen Paddock, the shooter, used a device called a bump stock to increase the rapidity of his shots.In the days that followed the massacre, there was a push to curtail bump stocks that earned the support of even some members of Trumps own party and tepidly the NRA.But the White House wasnt interested in talking about how to address the issue of mass shootings in the hours after the attack.During the White House news briefing the next day, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was explicit in postponing any discussion of addressing any underlying causes.On Oct. 1, a crowd of thousands had gathered in Las Vegas for a music festival.Then bullets rained down from the sky.Survivors describe the shock and terror of the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history.(The Washington Post) Look, this is an unspeakable tragedy, she said.Today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost.Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with all of those individuals.Theres a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country.A motive is yet to be determined, she continued, and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we dont fully know all the facts or what took place last night.She did, though, then talk about how gun laws hadnt prevented a rash of shootings in Chicago, and noted that one of the things that we dont want to do is try to create laws that wont stop these types of things from happening.When Trump traveled to Vegas, he rejected out-of-hand any discussion of new policies to limit gun ownership.Were not going to talk about that today, he said.We wont talk about that.The national conversation quickly turned to his response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico.Trumps response to the attack in New York on Tuesday was immediately different.Since the attack, at about 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Trump has tweeted (as of writing) six times about it and about the need for policy changes to address it.My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack.God and your country are with you!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 And so on.This is not a new pattern for Trump.Hes regularly raced to link terrorist attacks (and things that turned out not to be terrorist attacks) to the need to crack down on immigration.Its of a piece with his campaign, during which he promoted the risks posed by immigrants as a central concern for the public and his own policies as the only way of addressing them.Contrasting the two incidents in October mirrors the overall difference between gun violence and terrorism.Since Trump was inaugurated, there have been 283 incidents in the United States in which four or more people were shot.The death toll from those incidents, excluding Vegas, is 224.There have been a handful of terrorist attacks, perhaps only three of which involve a Muslim or an immigrant (though its not clear).In those incidents, two people were killed.Interestingly, Trump describes the perpetrators of the attacks in Vegas and New York in the same language.Paddock was a sick man, a demented man, in Trumps description, as was Sayfullo Saipov, identified by police as the killer in Manhattan.In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person.Law enforcement is following this closely.NOT IN THE U.S.A.!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 Trump likely means this in two different senses, though.Paddock was sick in the sense that he was mentally broken and nothing could be done to prevent his actions.Saipov was sick in that his actions were sick, and his reported allegiance to the Islamic State is what spurred him to that action.Part of this is rooted in how Trump considers people like Paddock versus how he considers people like Saipov.Saipovs actions are inseparable from his status as an immigrant, as Trumps tweets make clear: What he did is a reflection of all immigrants and therefore immigration laws need to change.Paddock older, white was just a guy with a broken brain.What can you possibly do about that?So, with Saipov, Trump is quick to weigh in on policy proposals meant to address the perceived threat posed by immigrants even if those proposals are not necessarily rooted in an accurate understanding of the issue.Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017 Both Vegas and New York were tragedies and, in both cases, many elected officials will be looking for ways to prevent similar things from happening again.For Trump, though, the events pose dissimilar risks to the American people.One exemplifies the existential threat from radical terrorists that must be addressed.One the much deadlier one is just a thing that happens.
Democrats add to ‘Better Deal’ platform with a slew of pro-labor-union ideas:::::Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks with reporters outside the chamber on July 25.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Senate Democrats are rolling out another plank in their Better Deal platform today, a series of pro-labor reforms aimed at strengthening the collective voice and negotiating rights of workers.Like the rest of the Democrats policy proposals, the eight-part labor plank has no serious chance of passage in a Republican-controlled Congress.Like previous planks on the economy and banking, it reflects talks among Democrats, their staff and outside analysts who want to see a more progressive party.Democrats are redoubling our commitment to working men and women with these proposals, Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in a statement.Were offering the middle class and those struggling to get there a better deal by taking on companies that undermine unions and underpay their workers, and beginning to unwind a rigged system that undermines every workers freedom to negotiate with their employer.The labor plank of the Better Deal is ambitious, anticipating court and National Labor Relations Board decisions that could go against unions in the next four years.Among them: A federal law that provides public workers with the same rights and freedom to engage in collective bargaining as their private sector counterparts, designed to prevent the piecemeal right-to-work efforts that have taken off in Republican-run states since 2011.A ban on state right-to-work laws altogether, as they have been found to reduce union membership by up to 10 percent and have resulted in lower wages and decreased access to employer-provided health care and pensions.Making it easier to strike with a ban [on] the permanent replacement of striking workers.Limiting employers ability to campaign against union drives.When companies taint the election process by using captive audience meetings, the NLRB will set the corrupted election results aside and require the employer to bargain with the worker representative, Democrats write in the Better Deal white paper.The main problem facing this installment of the Better Deal is one thats bedeviled every Democratic policy rollout: The difficulty of getting anyone to notice.Democrats and activists always planned to use this week, long anticipated as the beginning of the GOPs tax cut push, to propose policy alternatives.On Tuesday, Schumer and other Senate Democrats rolled out a plan to expand 401(k) plans, to exploit voter worry about how Republicans might tax those plans to pay for lower overall tax rates.The Democrats proposal: Allow people under 50 to save $24,500 in the plans annually, and people over 50 to save $30,500.But the rollout of that plan, at a news conference attended by Capitol Hill reporters, got relatively scant coverage.The Better Deal is covered not as an ongoing messaging effort, but as one event in July that quickly lost voters attention.(It quickly disappeared, wrote Post columnist Dana Milbank on Tuesday night.)The 401(k) plan and the Better Deal labor plank follow a similar theory of messaging, hammering issues that have been elevated and mishandled by Republicans and the Trump administration.Democrats believe that the White House gave away a serious political advantage in early 2017, when after meeting with building trades leaders, the president let a trillion dollar infrastructure plan drop off the first-year agenda.Trump, who had made historic electoral gains with union members, didnt consolidate them.But labor leaders have remained irritated with the Democrats.Last week, at the AFL-CIOs conference in St. Louis, union members passed a resolution in favor of new directions in electoral politics, a shot across the bow of Democrats and their resilient neoliberal wing.In the results of national elections, whether the candidates elected are from the Republican or Democratic Party, the interests of Wall Street have been protected and advanced, while the interests of labor and working people have generally been set back, read the resolution.While continuing to endorse friends and allies of workers, the AFL-CIO pursues a strategy of advancing our core issues through referenda and ballot initiatives and propositions at the statewide and local level; studies the viability of independent and third-party politics; and explores other reasonable means of advancing the interests of labor in electoral politics.The Better Deals labor plank is designed to quiet some of that angst, and demonstrate that Democrats will roll back anti-union laws if they win power.But the party is unlikely to get many chances to discuss its ideas this week.On Wednesday morning, instead of talking up the partys tax and labor plans, Schumer was engaged in the latest of many spats with the president over immigration and visa policy.
Trump’s New York attack response fits his pattern after a crisis: Cast blame and get political:::::In the wake of a deadly attack in New York City, President Trump is pointing the finger, playing fast and loose with the facts, repeating theories from right-wing media and saying things that gin up his base.And he's doing it all on Twitter.In tweets Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, Trump confirmed a pattern about how he handles moments of crisis: Find the angle that fits his political narratives.Let's break down how he did that with this particular attack.1.He watches cable news and comments on it On Wednesday morning, Trump quoted guests who appear on Fox and Friends, rather than sharing what he learned, say, in top-level security briefings with people who have access to the latest intelligence."Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems" said Col.Tony Shaffer.We will stop this craziness!@foxandfriends Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 On a near-weekly basis, Trump repeats ideas and seizes on comments that cable news especially Fox are discussing.Just Monday, Trump was apparently watching Fox and Friends and live tweeting what he saw there minutes before a political crisis broke for him: that his former campaign chairman had been indicted on financial crime charges.Great job by MichaelCaputo on @foxandfriends.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017 2.He jumps out ahead of the publicly stated facts to come to a conclusion.We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere.Enough!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 Trump has arrived at two conclusions about this attack that aren't yet supported by publicly known facts: That the attacker has ties to the Islamic State, and that he came to the United States via a visa program.It's likely the president knows more information than we do.But investigators in New York tell The Washington Post that they're still looking into how this man got to the United States and why he drove a truck into people.Was this an Islamic State-inspired attack, or was he acting as part of a broader plot?This isn't the first time Trump has gotten ahead of the facts.Hours after a bomb detonated on a London train in September, Trump called it a terrorist attack.London police told CNN that was pure speculation and that such speculation was unhelpful.Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.Must be proactive!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 3.He comes to a conclusion that is politically beneficial to him.We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere.Enough!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 Trump seemed to perk up while watching Fox and Friends.There's a possibility this man came to the United States on a visa program?One championed by Democrats?That fits neatly into Trump's agenda.He wants to make it much more difficult for immigrants to come to the United States.He also supports a bill in Congress that drastically revamps the current U.S. immigration system to cut legal immigration in half and base visa entries on merit, rather than need.As The Post's Philip Bump has pointed out, there's a notable disparity in how Trump responds to attacks by Muslims and on Muslims or his political opponents.For the former, he's quick to jump to conclusions.Politically, that's helpful for Trump: He's fighting to instate a travel ban that targets mostly majority-Muslim countries.(Though Uzbekistan, where police believe the attacker is from, has never been on the list.)On the latter attacks targeting Muslims or his political opponents he has waited days to respond.4.He seeks to cast blame elsewhere.We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).@foxandfriends Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 Trump staked his candidacy and presidency on keeping America safe.A deadly terrorist attack under his watch isn't helpful to that narrative.It's much easier to blame a visa program Congress passed two decades ago for letting this guy in.Trump casts blame when under pressure.After a white supremacist supporter drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters in Charlottesville, Trump blamed both sides for the violence.After Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump blamed Republicans.After four U.S. soldiers died in Niger under questionable circumstances in October, Trump appeared to put the attack on my generals.Pres.Trump says he didn't "specifically" authorize Niger mission, but gave generals "authority to do what's right so that we win."pic.twitter.com/OAPqjpo3Ja ABC News (@ABC) October 25, 2017 On Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded to Trump zeroing in on him after the attack: President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution anti-terrorism funding which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.5.He plucks theories directly from right-wing media and states them as fact.As The Post's Derek Hawkins and Samantha Schmidt report, some right-wing media jumped on a local ABC story that the attacker came to the United States from a diversity lottery visa program and connected some dubious dots to misstate who was responsible for it.Schumer did help conceive of that visa program, but it got rolled into a larger immigration package that Republicans supported and a Republican president signed.And as Trump critic Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) points out, Schumer supported getting rid of the visa program several years ago.This is far from the first time Trump has leaned on the far right for his facts or to prove a point.After Charlottesville, Trump retweeted an alt-right conspiracy theorist asking where the media outrage was on gun violence in Chicago.And probably his most infamous unproven claim is that President Obama wiretapped his campaign.The claim appeared to have its roots in an article on conservative blog Breitbart, which is owned by Trump's former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.Terrible!Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.Nothing found.This is McCarthyism!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 6.He says stuff that gins up his base.I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 It's likely not a coincidence Trump has seized on a visa program with diversity in the name as the culprit of this attack.Diversity is a word that sets off alarm bells for some on the right, who view it as a politically correct code word for allowing other people to take jobs, change the demographics of their community, etc.It seems to have worked.As Hawkins and Schmidt also report: By early Wednesday morning, Diversity Visa was trending on Twitter, appearing in more than 53,000 tweets.Some users shared graphic illustrations of a pair of hands with blood dripping from them.You have blood on your hands Chuck, one tweet read.From casting Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, to refusing to unequivocally denounce white supremacists to peddling a birther conspiracy theory about Obama, Trump has long stoked this side of some of his supporters.
Donald Trump Jr. vows to take half his daughter’s Halloween goodies in a bad lesson on socialism:::::You may remember, what seems like 15 years ago, when Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to offer a candy-related metaphor.In this metaphor, a bowl full of Skittles were refugees, but three of the Skittles were poison.There were many problems with this metaphor.Trump is back at it with the candy-related metaphors, seeking to make a point about socialism using his daughter's trick-or-treating haul from Halloween on Tuesday night.And yet again, he doesn't seem to have thought it through completely.Im going to take half of Chloes candy tonight & give it to some kid who sat at home.Its never to early to teach her about socialism.pic.twitter.com/3ie9C0jv2G Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 31, 2017 I'm going to take half of Chloe's candy tonight & give it to some kid who sat at home, Trump Jr. declared.It's never to early to teach her about socialism.As with the Skittles tweet, Trump appears to have cribbed this idea from someone else.Alex Jones's conspiracy-theory website posted something Monday featuring a video of kids having to turn over their candy in the name of socialism.WATCH: Kids Learn Painful Lesson on Socialism with Their Halloween Candy, reads the headline.And as with the Skittles tweet, this one was met with plenty of skepticism and derision.There are clearly problems with it not the least of which is that we're now using cute little kids on Halloween to make political points and that Trump misspelled too while talking about teaching his daughter something.It's also a gross oversimplification, to be sure.Socialism is defined by the government controlling the means of production and the distribution of goods and services not simply by high taxes and the rich sharing their wealth with the poor.In fact, our own system, via the graduated income tax, already leads to the wealthy subsidizing the poor through higher income taxes and taxes in general.Someone in the highest income bracket already pays 39.6 percent of their income beyond $418,000 (or beyond $470,000 if married filing jointly) in federal taxes, and in fact, the marginal tax rate for high earners in Trump's home state of New York is already around 50 percent.So that's actually about the correct amount of candy for Trump to confiscate -- if we're considering candy as "income" -- even in our capitalist country.(Coincidental note and full disclosure: The daddy tax in our house just happens to be 50 percent mostly collected in Dots, taffy and assorted gummy products but not because I'm teaching my 2-year-old a political lesson.)There are certainly ways in which the wealthy avoid taxes which many noted in response to Trump's tweet and income via investments is taxed differently.But the point stands that turning over a large chunk of candy would be expected from someone with the last name Trump.It's also true that taxation isn't merely taking someone's wealth and handing it to another person.The money is used for government services -- roads and bridges, scientific research, police, the military, etc.-- that the wealthy person may also enjoy.They'll pay more for those services ultimately, but it's not a matter of simply handing the money over to someone else.And then there's the inescapable fact that Trump's daughter just literally accepted handouts from other people rather than earning the candy herself via hard work.As some noted, that's pretty socialism-y.You literally took her door-to-door demanding free handouts.https://t.co/DGwsw2a7MB G. Willow Wilson (@GWillowWilson) October 31, 2017 Perhaps it's time to stop boiling complicated issues down to sugary treats.What I think we can all agree on is this: giving away candy to some kid stuck at home would be a really kind thing to do.https://t.co/yYJxfjrkOc Sam Stein (@samstein) November 1, 2017
Six police officers subdued and handcuffed a reporter covering Ed Gillespie. An officer said it was for swearing.:::::A Fairfax County police officer pulls Shareblue reporter Mike Stark's foot out from under him.(Shareblue) Mama said swearing is not polite, but the law in Fairfax County, Va., says it is illegal.That's right.Under a local ordinance, if any person profanely curse or swear or be drunk in public, he shall be deemed guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor, which in Virginia carries a fine of up to $250.Is that even constitutional?There is no question that profanely curse or swear has been ruled unconstitutional, Fairfax criminal defense lawyer Robert C. Whitestone said, meaning that an ordinance that would restrict foul language would not pass muster.Whatever.Fairfax County police decided to crack down on cussing Saturday at a parade in Annandale attended by Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie.In a video posted by the liberal website Shareblue, one of the site's reporters can be seen in the midst of a verbal confrontation with a police officer, who tells him to get out of the road.You're in the road, the officer says, though the reporter, Mike Stark, is not in the road but rather in the entrance of a parking lot.Get on the sidewalk.I'm a f---ing reporter doing my job, Stark protests.If you curse again, in front of us, you're going to jail, a second officer warns.F--- this, Stark responds.Go to jail, the second officer answers.[Where in the world is Ed?]Things escalate from there.The two officers turn Stark to face a fence and attempt to handcuff him.They struggle to do so, for reasons that are not apparent on video, and the first officer pulls Stark's right foot from under him, sending Stark to the ground.Stop, I will give you my arm, Stark says, with the officers on top of him and his left arm pinned between his chest and the ground.Put your hands up, one of the officers says.I can't, Stark replies.You have your weight on top of me.I cannot give you my hand.My hand is stuck beneath me.Four more officers converge on Stark.What's in his hand?What's in his hand?one of the officers says.Nothing!Stark yells.Finally, the officers cuff Stark and roll him onto his right side.So, do you always arrest people for cursing?he asks.Yes, one of the officers replies.It's called curse and abuse: 5-1-1.It's a county code.It sure is, but the claim that Fairfax County police always arrest violators strains credulity.Fairfax court records show Stark was taken into custody for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.A police spokeswoman did not respond to a Fix inquiry on that point or answer other questions, such as why it was necessary to bring Stark to the ground and why six officers were required to subdue him.A police spokesman told another Washington Post reporter that they weren't yet prepared to comment.[Video shows officers taking reporter to ground at parade that included GOP candidate Ed Gillespie in Virginia]
The Energy 202: Pruitt cites Bible in ending way EPA committees staffed:::::THE LIGHTBULB Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will no longer allow scientists with EPA funding to serve on its scientific advisory boards.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) It's official: After much speculation in recent days, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt announced on Tuesday he was upending the way the agencys key advisory groups are staffed.The news: Any researcher who receives EPA grant money is now barred from serving as an adviser on the Scientific Advisory Board, the Clean Air Science Advisory Committee and the Board of Scientific Counselors.The Post's Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin have the full story here.Why it matters: The move would ban a large swath of researchers currently on the boards, and open more spots for scientists funded by alternative sources including by regulated companies.Environmental and scientific groups were quick to condemn the changes, arguing that industry-friendly boards could lead to less rigorous environmental protection.More: Pruitt, a deeply religious Christian, pulled a passage from the Book of Joshua to justify his decision."Joshua says to the people of Israel: choose this day whom you are going to serve," Pruitt said, according to BuzzFeed News."This is sort of like the Joshua principle that as it relates to grants from this agency, you are going to have to choose either service on the committee to provide counsel to us in an independent fashion or chose the grant.But you cant do both.Thats the fair and great thing to do."Or as New York Times reporter Lisa Friedman put it: I think Pruitt just likened himself to Joshua leading the Israelites to the Promised Land by ending ability of EPA advisors to get grants Lisa Friedman (@LFFriedman) October 31, 2017 In July, Niina Heikkinen of E&E News published a fascinating piece on how religion may inform Pruitt's deregulatory ideology.The takeaway is that the creation story in Genesis shows that God has given mankind dominion over Earth.In contrast, environmentalists, as one pastor in the piece put it, "have started worshiping God's creation, the planet and all the living organisms on it, instead of God."POWER PLAYS Sam Clovis speaks during a news conference as then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump watches before a campaign rally in Dubuque, Iowa in 2016.(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) -- The Trump-Russia story gets an environmental angle: Among the many big revelations this week in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign co-chairman, encouraged another Trump campaign adviser to foster ties with Russian officials.The Clovis news is especially relevant because his nomination hearing to become the Agriculture Departments chief scientist is tentatively scheduled in the Senate for Nov. 9.Scientists and Democratic lawmakers, already inclined to vote against Clovis due to his "extremely skeptical (Clovis's words) stance on climate change, used the Mueller news to further skewer the nominee.In every aspect, Clovis falls far short of the standards demanded by the position, the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote to senators in a one-page letter with 3,100 signers.One of the senators to whom that letter was addressed, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, told USA Today the "emerging information about his role in the Trump campaigns interactions with Russia raises serious concerns."Meanwhile, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), one of the chamber's biggest climate hawks, said: Sam Clovis is a climate denier, not a scientist.Hes nominated USDA Chief Scientist.Obviously ridiculous.He should

Beaufort Sea coast in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.(U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service) -- The GOP's plan to offset $1 billion in tax cuts by allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may not be realistic, Jennifer Dlouhy and Alex Nussbaum of Bloomberg News report.Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, called the plan pure fantasy.Data from previous Arctic oil lease sales suggest the U.S. is likely to collect less than a fifth of that billion-dollar goal over the next decade -- about $145.5 million -- from auctioning off territory in the sprawling northeast Alaska refuge where caribou calve and polar bears roam, Dlouhy and Nussbaum write.Oil companies may be scared away by the controversies and costs of drilling in that remote and fragile terrain.Even if they arent, crude prices would have to be some $15 more per barrel than they are today to make the effort pay off at all.Why does that number matter?Congress has sole authority to approve drilling in the Arctic refuge, but Republicans have never had the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster.So the Alaska congressional delegation, interested in opening ANWR, has turned to incorporating ANWR authorization into the budget package at various points since the 1980s.That maneuver requires only 50 votes, but in the process Congressional Republicans are counting on a $1 billion windfall from Arctic drilling that, according to Bloomberg News, will likely never come.From Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society in New York: Just your typical

Suniva and SolarWorld "that brought the action before the board had requested leaving few parties happy with the outcome along with lingering uncertainty over the ultimate end point of the process, which will be determined by President Trump.Meanwhile, most of the nations solar industry has warned that a move to raise the price of imported panels could threaten U.S. solar jobs.In the middle sits Trump, who seems to be interested in taking some trade-related jab at China, a big solar panel producer and one of the president's favorite punchbags on the campaign trail.Trump has the discretion to

The Health 202: The good, the bad ... and the truth about Obamacare signup season:::::THE PROGNOSIS The six-week enrollment period for 2018 Obamacare coverage starts today.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Youll hear two competing narratives over the next six weeks, as Americans without employer-sponsored coverage buy plans on Healthcare.gov and state-run marketplaces during the Affordable Care Acts fifth signup season.Here they are: Narrative 1: Obamacare was working beautifully until President Trump and his Republican cronies sabotaged the law, pushing up premiums, driving insurers away and confusing people about whether the ACA even exists anymore.Narrative 2: Obamacare is in an unavoidable death spiral because its a fundamentally flawed law, forcing up premiums and reducing choices for consumers who are losing out big time under it.The truth is, neither narrative is entirely correct, despite what you might hear from relatives around the Thanksgiving table a few weeks from now.The Trump administration according to the way it has framed this years diminished options and higher premiums would have you believe the situation is unavoidably out of its control.The sharp contrast between how it's handling things and how the Obama administration approached the marketplaces has been clearer than ever over the past few days.Were the prior administration around, the Department of Health and Human Services would be stressing that most consumers are sheltered from premium hikes because of federal subsidies.Its top officials would be fanning out across the United States to hold outreach events.But this week, representatives of HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services didnt respond to questions about whether their leaders Eric Hargan and Seema Verma have events planned today to mark the first day of open enrollment.Democrats, dismayed at the prospect that recent coverage gains under the ACA could be reversed, are accusing the administration of hurling a wrecking ball at an otherwise healthy individual market.Several groups that have sprung up to defend the law from GOP attacks many of them run by Obama appointees or Democratic operatives are heaping blame on Trump for unaffordable premiums.While many Americans will pay more due to President Trumps sabotage, millions of Americans can still find affordable health coverage, Protect Our Care Director Brad Woodhouse said in a statement yesterday.A sign on an insurance store advertises Obamacare in San Diego.(REUTERS/Mike Blake) Lets eat some reality pie: The truth lies somewhere in the middle.The administration could be doing a lot more to support the marketplaces.But the marketplaces have also failed to attract the healthy mix of enrollees needed to keep prices lower.Here are three things to watch during enrollment season (which starts today and ends Dec. 15): 1.The enrollment number to beat (or fall short of) is 12.2 million.Thats how many people selected a marketplace plan during 2017 enrollment.Most experts have predicted that sign-ups will be significantly less this year perhaps by as much as 1 million given the administrations cuts to advertising and outreach and only six weeks for consumers to enroll instead of three months.2.Obamacare is getting cheaper for people whose low income qualifies them for premium subsidies.About 80 percent of marketplace enrollees will qualify for the federal assistance, up from 71 percent last year, according to numbers from CMS.This seems counterintuitive, right?After all, Trump cut off extra cost-sharing payments for insurers, prompting them to raise premiums even more to make up the difference.But thats precisely why the premium subsidies are getting more generous.Theyre based on the cost of a mid-level silver plan.And because silver premiums are rising, subsidies are, too.3.But fewer people ineligible for subsidies are buying individual plans.They could drop off even more as premiums go up because these folks arent sheltered from the increases.This year, 5.4 million people bought their health insurance outside the ACA marketplaces.You cant get subsidies off the exchanges, so these shoppers were presumably higher-income earners who cant get the federal assistance anyway.But this number has been declining dramatically.Even though the marketplaces got 3.8 million new enrollees for 2017, individual market enrollment actually fell by 12 percent overall, according to a July report by Mark Farrah Associates.The moral of the story?Obamacare coverage is totally affordable if you get help from the federal government in buying it.But if you dont get help, buying that coverage is a lot harder.AHH, OOF and OUCH New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R).(AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) AHH: Trump's opioid commission will issue a final report today calling for big boosts in substance-abuse treatment programs but stopping short of urging the funding officials would need to implement changes, Politico reports.Led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), the report will recommend the administration increase access to addiction treatment and recovery programs, expand the availability of medication-assisted therapies and strengthen the power of first responders to administer the life-saving overdose reversal drug, naloxone, according to a draft obtained by Brianna Ehley and Sarah Karlin-Smith."The commissions final meeting and report come just one week after Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency a move seen as a largely symbolic gesture that provided no new funding," Brianna and Sarah write."Administration officials have characterized the declaration as a jumping off point and said the president would incorporate recommendations from the commission.""While the panel acknowledges that lack of funding is the main barrier to implementation, it doesn't lay out a figure, project how long money will be needed or where it should come from," the two write."The report says, for example, the 'principal factors' limiting the expansion of drug courts are insufficient funding, treatment and supervision resources, not a lack of interest....It also emphasizes the need for 'significant funding,' to increase the number of doctors trained in addiction medicine and to fund research on new pain, overdose reversal and addiction treatments."OOF: Republicans control the House and the Senate.Oh, and the White House, too.But why not keep blaming Democrats for blocking them from repealing Obamacare?That's the message in a new RNC ad, which points to the ACA's "skyrocketing" insurance premiums and says Democrats blocked a better plan to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all obstructing our president just to score political points with the radical left."President Trump will fix it," says the ad, which appeared nationwide yesterday."He wants what's best for the American people.Top-quality health-care you can afford.Tell Washington Democrats, end the obstruction."Reality check: Republicans didn't need any Democrats to sign onto their various Obamacare repeal bills because they were using a special process requiring just 50 votes in the Senate instead of 60.The Senate failed to pass a health-care bill not because Democrats objected but because they couldn't get moderates and conservatives Republicans to back it.(AP Photo/Jessica Hill, File) OUCH: Aetna's doing great financially -- except when it comes to the ACA marketplaces.The companys CFO Shawn Guertin said on a Tuesday earnings call that Aetna is continuing to experience underlying losses from covering marketplace enrollees, even after the company scaled back marketplace participation in 2017, the Washington Examiner reports.Once covering nearly 1 million marketplace enrollees, the company lost $700 million from 2014 to 2016.It was projected to lose $200 million in 2017.Still, the company exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations with a net profit of $838 million compared with $604 million for the third quarter in 2016, per Healthcare Finance News.And it lowered its medical benefit ratio (the percent of premiums spent on claims) for its commercial business to 81.4 percent, from 83.8 percent a year earlier.HEALTH ON THE HILL House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.).(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) JUST SAY NO: Republicans will not try to repeal the ACA's individual mandate to buy coverage as part of their tax overhaul, despite requests from some conservatives.House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)rejected a plan from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)to include the repeal, warning that it could kill the tax revision.Look, I love these ideas from senators on health care, but what my constituents are looking at are for action on health care from our senators...Im still hopeful they can find a way forward.What I dont want to do is to add things that could again kill tax reform like health care died over there, Brady told radio host Hugh Hewitt yesterday.Cotton said he wanted to use repeal of the mandate to raise money for a tax package, telling reporters earlier this week he had the support to include it in the tax plan."Almost every colleague with whom I have spoken is favorably disposed toward repealing the individual mandate of Obamacare as part of that tax package," Cotton said Monday, per the Washington Examiner.But Brady suggested that wasn't likely, given how the Senate's various health-care bills have fared so far.Look, I want to see that individual mandate repealed, Brady said.I just havent seen, no one has seen 50 votes in the Senate to do it.But Brady did say he'd support adding the individual mandate repeal once a tax bill got to the Senate floor.Rep.

Wednesday.Facing a pileup of disagreements over basic elements of a tax code overhaul, House Republicans late Tuesday decided to delay the rollout of the first draft of their bill, originally set for this morning.Now, theyre aiming to debut the package tomorrow.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)made it official in a statement released after 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, stating that his panel is pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week.But the Halloween hiccup points to a package in such flux that an all-nighter would have been insufficient to get it in presentable shape.Heres what we know about the bill, such as it is, via my colleagues Damian Paletta and Mike DeBonis.Whats

Republicans can make the corporate rate cut permanent, owing to its cost : Business leaders will fight hard to prevent Republicans from allowing the rate to go back up after several years, but the GOP could be hamstrung because it cannot push into law a tax change that adds too much to the deficit.: Business leaders will fight hard to prevent Republicans from allowing the rate to go back up after

may be that the best hope for a tax package would involve the Senate GOP passing whatever it can and then asking House Republicans to simply swallow it whole.These are just the fundamentals.As the

were killed and 11 injured when a truck allegedly rented by Saipov plowed through cyclists on the Hudson River bike route.Trump seemed to at least partly blame Democrats for lenient immigration

Powell.(Reuters/Joshua Roberts) FED WATCH: Tightening apace.FT's Sam Fleming: "Janet Yellen will on Wednesday chair what may be one of her final meetings at the helm of the US Federal Reserve as the spotlight falls on whether monetary policy will shift after her expected departure.President Donald Trump is expected to nominate a replacement for Ms Yellen this week but the central banks slow but determined course towards tighter monetary policy seems set to endure, as Jay Powell, her most likely successor, inherits an established strategy and strengthening recovery... 'The strategy under Yellen is probably set to survive for a long time we are on a gradual path to higher rates and that will suit Powell fine,' said Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro, a research firm."Powell's rich.The Post's Heather Long: "In some ways, though, Powell, who goes by the nickname Jay, fits the mold of a typical Trump pick for a premium post.He's a Republican who built a vast wealth as a partner at Carlyle.Powell's latest financial disclosure from June lists his net worth between $19.7 million and $55 million.If he gets the job, Powell would be the richest Fed chair since banker Marriner Eccles, who held the position from 1934 to 1948, according to Washington Post reviews of former Fed chair financial disclosures and former Fed historian Gary Richardson...But the expected decision to tap Powell highlights how Trump is willing to compromise the bomb-throwing mentality that has characterized much of his time in Washington and many of his appointments.Powell has developed a reputation in Washington as a consensus builder who prefers to operate behind the scenes.President Barack Obama felt comfortable enough with Powell to nominate him to the Fed board in 2012, renominating him again in 2014."Stacking the Fed.Politico's Danny Vinik: "No president has ever had a chance to rewrite the course of the Federal Reserve as completely, and as quickly, as President Donald Trump.When Trump picks a new head of the Federal Reservea move expected to happen on Thursdayit will be just the midpoint of his reshaping of the nations most important financial body.Hes likely to fill three more critical positions at the Fed: the vice chair, and two spots on the Fed Board of Governors.Combined with Governor Randy Quarles, who was confirmed by the Senate in October, Trump has a chance to nominate five of seven Fed governors by early next year.But just what Trump will do with that power remains unclear."TAX FLY-AROUND: Trump speaks during a meeting on tax policy with business leaders at the White House on Tuesday.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Mess of a salesman.The Post's John Wagner and David Nakamura on Trump's ability to pitch a tax cut under the gathering cloud of the Russia probe: "Aides insisted the twin challenges at home and abroad would not be undermined by the indictments, but the frustration of the president whose job approval ratings hit a new low this week in Gallup polling was evident Tuesday.He started the day with a spate of tweets in which he lashed out at the media and Crooked Dems and urged a focus instead on the Massive Tax Cuts he has promised to deliver by Christmas.In a bid to show he remains focused on the tasks at hand, Trump later in the day allowed reporters to witness the start of a White House meeting with business leaders at which he boasted that the December signing of the yet-to-be-unveiled GOP tax bill would be 'the biggest tax event in the history of our country.'"Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) Mnuchin: No market crash imminent.NYT's Alan Rappeport: "Mr. Mnuchin came under fire in recent weeks after reports that he was threatening lawmakers that financial markets would tank if the tax bill faltered.But he said that he made no such warning and had only suggested that stock markets would do even better if the tax cuts passed.'If you look at the stock market, as Ive said, the stock market is clearly up in anticipation of economic activity and economic growth from the Trump administration plan,' Mr. Mnuchin said.An unpopular plan.CNBC's John Harwood: "President Trump and congressional Republicans begin their drive to cut taxes with lackluster public support, according to the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey shows that just 25 percent call the Trump tax plan a good idea, while 35 percent call it a bad idea.The remaining 40 percent say they have no opinion.'For what is a major legislative objective of the president and his party, tax reform is in very mushy shape,' said Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who helps produce the NBC/WSJ poll... As the debate gets underway, the poll shows, just 14 percent of Americans believe they'll get a tax cut, while 25 percent expect their taxes to go up.Similarly, just 19 percent of Americans say the tax legislation will significantly improve the economy.At the same time, 35 percent expect it will substantially increase the budget deficit."Biggest ever?Trump claims the superlative again for a tax bill that hasn't premiered yet: The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve.These will be biggest ever!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 It depends how you measure and on what the bill can achieve, the WSJ's Richard Rubin writes: "The clearest way to measure the size of a tax cut is by comparing it to the size of the economy.That way, inflation and increases in population don't obscure the magnitude, and the effect of changes in tax breaks are measured along with changes in tax rates.By that yardstick, the proposed tax cut of about $150 billion a year, is 0.7% of gross domestic product over the next four years.The Treasury Department tracks this exact statistic, and the largest single tax cut by this measure is the 1981 plan pushed by President Ronald Reagan, at 2.89% of GDP over the first four years... A White House spokeswoman says the metric being used is the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%.By that stat, the president's claim is correct.The corporate rate has been above 20% since 1940, and the largest previous one-time drop was in the 1986 tax bill, which lowered it to 34% from 46%."Trick or tax.There isn't much for Democrats to do these days in the tax debate, since Republicans have mostly locked them out of it.So they're focusing on messaging against the plan.This week, that's meant getting in the Halloween spirit, for better or worse.Here was House Ways and Means Committee Democrat Lloyd Doggett (Tex.): With Halloween approaching, I have a candy message to share about the Republican tax bill that is expected to be introduced this week.pic.twitter.com/G2L73EJBRC Lloyd Doggett (@RepLloydDoggett) October 30, 2017 And here was apparently the best effort from Senate Democrats: Tomorrow, the GOP is expected to finally unveil #TrumpTax plan, but w/ planned middle class tax hikes, we're sure it's in the upside down.pic.twitter.com/aCMmaD3EFj Senate Democrats (@SenateDems) October 31, 2017 Why the Dow Jones Industrial Average Crushed the S&P 500 in October The Dow industrials raced past its peers in October, as a pickup in economic growth around the world boosted shares of blue-chip companies that sell everything from bulldozers to airplanes.WSJ U.S. Consumer Confidence Just Hit Its Highest Level in Almost 17 Years U.S. consumer confidence rose more than expected in October to the highest in almost 17 years as Americans grew more confident about the economy and job market, according to figures Tuesday from the New York-based Conference Board.Bloomberg TRUMP TRACKER RUSSIA WATCH: Senate Judiciary Committee witnesseses included Colin Stretch, Facebook General Council, Sean Edgett, Twitter acting General Counsel, and Richard Salgado Google, Director Law Enforcement and Information Security, on Capitol Hill.(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Tech giants face heat.WSJ's Byron Tau and Deepa Seetharaman: "Senators pressed representatives from three technology giants to explain why they didnt recognize Russia-linked accounts earlier, as the officials struck a contrite tone about the role their services played in stoking political tensions during the 2016 campaign.Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.s Google and Twitter Inc. were all summoned in front of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, where officials told members of Congress that they were actively developing better policies for how to curb foreign activity on their platforms and ensure that foreign governments, terrorists and criminals arent able to abuse social media for nefarious purposes.The officials also faced questions about voter-suppression efforts and whether Silicon Valley can or should police speech."Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) was particularly tough.Watch him grilling the tech executives here: Trump holds back.The Post's Phil Rucker and Bob Costa: "Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges against three former Trump campaign officials.Despite his growing frustration with a federal probe he has roundly dismissed, Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly, at the urging of his attorneys inside and outside the White House.But several prominent Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have said they think the presidents posture is too timid.Seeing the investigation as a political threat, they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its funding.Still, Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller, a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under consideration.Senate Republicans, for their part, said Tuesday they won't support any efforts to cut off Mueller's funding or otherwise short-circuit his investigation.What Mueller's thinking.The Post's Matt Zapotosky: "If Mueller can find evidence that members of Trumps team conspired in Russias hacking effort by directing it or aiding in another way they might face criminal charges, legal analysts said.Papadopouloss plea says that he discussed some of his efforts to broker a meeting with the Russians with other, more senior Trump campaign officials although some seemed to treat him warily... Mueller could be working to convince Manafort and Gates to cooperate, and he could also be trying to send a message to others in Trumps orbit that he will leave no stone unturned and that those who deceive investigators will be charged, legal analysts said.But Mueller also could be signaling a charge he could pursue in connection with the coordination case a conspiracy to defraud the United States by coordinating with Russia."Via the NYT, read Manafort's memo application memo to Trump here.And check out this fun rundown of how he laundered $18 million and where he spent it.No coffee boy.The Post's Roz Helderman, Karen DeYoung and Tom Hamburger: "President Trump on Tuesday belittled former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty this week to lying to federal agents investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election, tweeting that 'few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.'But interviews and documents show that Papadopoulos was in regular contact with the Trump campaigns most senior officials and held himself out as a Trump surrogate as he traveled the world to meet with foreign officials and reporters.Papadopoulos sat at the elbow of one of Trumps top campaign advisers, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention, according to an individual who attended the meeting.He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office, where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government.And he conferred at one point with the foreign minister of Greece at a meeting in New York."Hope Hicks speaks!But not publicly."Trumps longtime aide and current communications director, Hope Hicks, is scheduled to speak with special counsel Robert Muellers team in mid-November, following the presidents trip to Asia," Politico's Anni Karney and Josh Dawsey write."Muellers team is also expected to interview three or four other current White House officials as early as this week, according to an administration official."Kushner redevelopment plan for 666 Fifth Ave. deemed not feasible by partner Trump friend Steve Roth says the grand scheme has gone away, putting project in doubt.Jonathan O'Connell and Michael Kranish Top Mnuchin aides private jet flight to Palm Beach was legal, but legal does not always equate to wise, watchdog finds The inspector general for the Treasury Department found that chief of staff Eli Miller and a hedge fund billionaire who offered him a ride on his private jet were friends and did not discuss business.Lisa Rein MONEY ON THE HILL House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.).(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) Hensarling retiring."Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who led conservative opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program and has been among Congresss fiercest foes of federal regulations, said Tuesday he will retire after his term ends," The Post's Mike DeBonis writes."Hensarling is set to leave the House as his term as chairman of the Financial Services Committee expires.In his six years in that post, he has pushed numerous conservative bills to pull back the federal role in overseeing the financial sector, including a bill that passed the House earlier this year repealing major parts of the Dodd-Frank law passed after the financial crisis of 2008.'Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,; he said in a statement.Noting the loss of his committee gavel, he said that 'the time seems right for my departure.'Hensarling has seen several of his legislative priorities frustrated by the Senate or by the wishes of more-moderate Republicans.The Dodd-Frank repeal bill, known as the Financial Choice Act, has not gotten Senate consideration.He has been unable to unravel the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency he has strongly opposed.And a bill he supported this year to reconfigure the National Flood Insurance Program was placed on the back burner after the devastation of Hurricane Harvey."The announcement will heat up the race to replace him.Politico's Zachary Warmbodt: "The lawmaker long seen as a top contender is Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who serves as the committee's vice chairman and the House GOP's chief deputy whip.McHenry could pursue a higher-ranking House leadership position instead if the opportunity presented itself.Other names that have been in the mix include Reps.

Trump, he said, is being pulled in two different directions by pro-trade and anti-trade voices in his administration.'Which direction will the administration go?I will tell you candidly: I dont know,' Cruz said.He added: 'I think it depends which voices will be listened to.'"Some trade experts believe the administration's goal is to "to blow up the entire legal framework governing world trade," the NYT's Eduardo Porter writes."What Washington truly seems to want is the kind of free hand it had in the 1980s to coerce one country after another into bringing its surplus with the United States down to zero."Post-Podesta shockwaves.Politico's Theodoric Meyer: "Washington lobbyists who represent foreign powers have taken comfort for decades in the fact that the Justice Department rarely goes after them for potentially breaking the law.That all changed on Monday.The news of Tony Podestas resignation from his namesake firm and indictment of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates sent K Street scrambling, as lobbyists rushed to make sure theyre in compliance with the rules.The developments also renewed calls for Congress to pass legislation beefing up the Justice Departments enforcement of the law, which lawmakers in both parties have derided for lacking teeth... Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced a bill along with Rep.

Sometimes a handful of protesters can spark an enormous discussion. That certainly happened in September.:::::Houston Texans owner Bob McNair is under fire for reportedly saying, "we can't have inmates running the prison."McNair apologized for the remarks.(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) This is the ninth installment in a monthly series reporting on political crowds in the United States.Each month the Crowd Counting Consortium will post updates about trends and patterns from the previous month as recorded by our volunteers.Find all the previous posts in the series here.For our counting methods, please see our first post in the series.For September, we tallied 578 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins and rallies in the United States, with at least one in every state and the District.Our conservative guess is that between 80,130 and 89,854 people showed up at these political gatherings, although it is likely there were far more participants.Because mainstream media often neglect to report nonviolent actions especially small ones it is probable that we did not record every event that took place.For 34.9 percent of the events we listed this month, we lacked an estimate of the size of the crowd.Nevertheless, we think our tally gives us a useful pool of information to better understand political mobilization in the United States particularly how reports of crowds change from month to month.In this case, we estimate that September saw a sizable decrease in people protesting compared with August, during which we observed between 175,625 and 205,178 people participating in crowds.Who demonstrated against and for what in September?1.The opposition to Trump Resistance against the Trump administration continued to drive most protests.We estimate that 85.1 percent of the events we recorded were opposing President Trumps policies.About 68.7 percent overall were explicitly anti-Trump while another 16.4 percent overall took stances on issues that contradict the president on issues like advocating for workers rights or protesting pipelines.When Trump announced on Sept. 5 that he would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, protesters turned out across the United States as, for example, dozens gathered in Albany; about a hundred protested in Anchorage; the Athens Immigration Rights Coalition in Georgia brought tens more out at the Arch; and more than 50 demonstrated in Yakima, Wash.Within weeks there were 175 DACA protests in all.When the protesters were National Football League players, a handful of protests drew enormous national attention.Last season, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the singing of the national anthem, in order to protest police shootings of African Americans and U.S. inequality.In September, Trump announced that he was against such protests after which many more NFL players knelt or locked arms during the national anthem.The protests spread beyond the NFL, reaching professional baseball as well as nonprofessional sporting events (or here in Tulsa) and even a substitute teacher in Littleton, Mass.Protests against specific police shootings continued as well.Thousands of people in the St. Louis area participated in days of protests denouncing the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011.Buffalo Bills players take a knee during the playing of the national anthem prior to a September game against the Denver Broncos.(AP) 2.The support for Trump About 6 percent of the events we recorded were rallies supporting the president and his policies, either directly or indirectly.As a share of events, Septembers total decreased significantly since August.The president held a large rally for Sen. Luther Strange with an estimated 9,000 people at Van Braun Arena in Huntsville, Ala. On Sept. 1, nearly 200 protesters came out in Allentown, Pa., to press Rep. Charlie Dent (R) to be more supportive of Trumps agenda.On Sept. 23, Tea Party Patriots gathered close to 400 people on Capitol Hill to demand that Republicans in Congress uphold campaign promises like repealing the Affordable Care Act.3.Neither for nor against Trump The final 8.8 percent of the crowds were involved in actions directed at other politicians or about issues that were neither pro- nor anti-Trump.We found a broad range of such topics, consistent with the trends from previous months, including a rally for partial government funding for a new baseball stadium in Pawtucket, R.I., and a rally in Jonesborough, Tenn., seeking the arrest of the driver who killed Shirra Branum in a vehicular accident.The driver was allegedly drunk at the time.We found a handful of events addressing the opioid crisis.Hundreds gathered in Fairborn, Ohio, for the third annual Fairborn Against Heroin Recovery Rally.Others demonstrated, and ran, in San Angelo, Tex., for the Let It Go!Recovery Rally and Run.In Shemanski Park, Oregonians piled up 1,000 shoes, each with a name written on it, to remember deceased loved ones.How many people were arrested and/or injured in political crowds?At about 543 events (about 94 percent), no arrests were made.This was almost exactly the same percentage as the prior month.In terms of people arrested, the numbers increased from 251 arrests in August to 533 in September, with at least 262 (about 49 percent) of those September arrests coming in 26 cases of nonviolent civil disobedience.Just over half the arrests occurred in greater St. Louis around Stockleys acquittal.[What led to the violence in Charlottesville?Heres what social science says.]The number of events with arrests that appeared to be connected to violence or property destruction declined from 31 events in August to 11 events in September.Likewise, we counted only 33 injuries in September, representing a significant decline from August, which saw 111 injuries and one death: of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville.You can download the data here.Well release the data for October 2017 soon.In the meantime, we are still counting.Click here to be counted, and click here to volunteer to help us count.Jeremy Pressman is an associate professor of political science and director of Middle East Studies at the University of Connecticut.Find him on Twitter @djpressman.
The Daily 202: Negative ads are helping Ed Gillespie win over Trump supporters in the Virginia governor’s race:::::With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: The dirty little secret about attack ads is that they usually work.Thats why campaigns run them, even though voters constantly complain about how much they hate negativity.Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for governor in Virginia, has been running some doozies this fall.Hes spent millions on often misleading ads that paint his patrician opponent, Democratic Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam, as soft on pedophiles and the Latino gang MS-13.Hes made the protection of Confederate monuments one of his signature issues.Im for keeping em up, and hes for taking em down, Gillespie says to camera.And thats a big difference in November!These spots represent a stunning about-face for a former Republican National Committee chairman who made a name for himself evangelizing about the need for the GOP to reject dog whistles and improve outreach to minorities.But Gillespie seems willing to trade his reputation for victory if thats what is required.And his strategy is paying dividends.A new Washington Post-Schar School poll finds that Northams lead has narrowed to five percentage points, down from 13 points a month ago.He leads among likely voters 49 percent to Gillespies 44 percent, a margin that is not statistically significant.The Republican has closed a motivation gap and seen his share of support rise among supporters of President Trump, without driving away independents and moderates.Gillespie is still the underdog, but if he prevails next week, it will be because he found a way to thread the needle in the age of Trump, maintaining his appeal to establishment Republicans while also wading into the fever swamps of Trumpism.This matters, even if you dont live in Virginia, because dozens of Republicans across the country are going to follow Gillespies playbook in 2018 if it works.Top GOP operatives in the battle for control of the House tell me that theyre watching closely, running polls and using focus groups to gauge the potency of the wedge issues Gillespie has embraced specifically MS-13 and sanctuary cities.They think Gillespie is showing a possible path to victory for several vulnerable Republicans in exurban districts.You are also likely to see similar lines of attack against Democratic senators and in several marquee governors races in purple states.Our story about the new poll quotes several respondents who are unnerved by Gillespies deflating and divisive messaging.A slight majority of Virginians 51 percent think Gillespie has run a mainly negative campaign.But 37 percent say the same of Northam.Scott Clement and Laura Vozzella note in their write-up of the results that there are only modest signs of backlash in the cross tabs: Voters split about evenly when asked whom they trust to handle illegal immigration, but Gillespie has an eight-percentage-point edge on trust to handle crime and public safety.Gillespie trailed by more than 20 points at the beginning of October in the swing-voting Northern Virginia exurbs that encompass Loudoun County.Now hes tied with Northam at 44 percent.Among self-identified conservatives, Gillespies lead over Northam grew from 56 points to 69 points.Gillespies lead among white voters without college degrees has increased from 25 points to 35 points.(Trump won this group by 47 points in 2016 exit polls.)Gillespies supporters have caught up to Northams in motivation to vote and in attention to the race.Among registered voters, an identical 71 percent of both Northam and Gillespie supporters say they are certain to vote or have already done so, a shift from four weeks ago, when Northam backers had a nearly 10-point edge on this measure.-- Gillespies commercials have moved the needle enough that Northam feels compelled to run a response ad decrying the fearmongering as despicable and false.Im a pediatrician, and for Ed Gillespie to say I would tolerate anyone hurting a child is despicable, Northam says to the camera.In politics, theres some truth to the old saying that when youre explaining youre losing.But theres also an existential risk in letting attacks this nasty go unanswered.Thats how swiftboated became a verb in 2004.-- Northam remains more likely than not to win next Tuesday.He has a big advantage on who voters trust more to handle health care and race, two concerns that are top of mind.Hes also up 11 points among women, who are more likely to vote than men.But the race is closer than the fundamentals suggest it should be.Virginia has moved to the left over the past decade.Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry the Old Dominion in a presidential election since Lyndon Johnson.Last year, with Sen. Tim Kaine on the ticket, Virginia was the only Southern state that Hillary Clinton carried.Trumps approval rating is 38 percent among likely voters, with 59 percent disapproving.Fifty-two percent of likely voters strongly disapprove of Trump.Youd expect that to be a significant anchor pulling down Gillespie, but Democrats have not successfully tied him to the unpopular president.(Hes getting 44 percent of the vote.)Gillespie now receives 95 percent support among people who approve of Trumps job performance.Northam is getting only 81 percent of those who disapprove of Trumps performance.Northam is trying to rectify his problem with the base in the home stretch.The lieutenant governor will spend this evening trying to gin up progressives in the D.C. suburbs, for example, by stumping with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in Arlington and then Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) in Dale City.-- The latest wrinkle: One liberal outside group chose to fight fire with fire, but its backfiring.The Latino Victory Fund launched a television ad on Monday that depicts four minority children running away from a pickup truck driven by a white man, flying a Confederate flag and has a Gillespie bumper sticker.The group pulled the commercial last night after a terrorist attack in New York City involved a pickup truck running down people on a bike path.(Much more on that below.)The ad was commissioned after an internal poll by Americas Voice, an immigration advocacy group, showed a lack of enthusiasm for Northam among Latinos and African Americans.Northams campaign urged the groups not to release the polls findings, according to multiple people familiar with the matter a point not disputed by his campaign, Ed O'Keefe, Gregory S. Schneider and Fenit Nirappil scoop.Surveying Latino voters in Virginia is difficult, given that they made up just 4.6 percent of all voters statewide last year But the private poll suggests Northam is lagging slightly behind the Latino support [Clinton] received last year.We knew our ad would ruffle feathers.We held a mirror up to the Republican Party and they dont like what they see, Latino Victory Fund President Cristbal J. Alex said last night.Gillespie brought this on with his relentless attacks on our community.This is a direct response.Northams campaign was not responsible for the commercial, but the candidate declined to repudiate it.Northam said Monday that Gillespies tactics have promoted fearmongering, hatred, bigotry, racial divisiveness.He added that its upset a lot of communities, and they have the right to express their views as well.Last night, a Northam spokesman said they didnt ask the group to take down the spot but it is appropriate and the right thing to do.-- The truck ad has given Gillespie an opening to take umbrage and further consolidate his base by winning sympathy from Trump supporters who may remain uneasy with him.Ralph Northam doesnt just disagree with millions of Virginians who dont share his liberal policy agenda, Gillespie said during a segment on Fox and Friends yesterday morning that focused on the ad.He disdains us.It also lets Gillespie muddy the waters with independents by arguing that neither side has a clean nose.The Posts Editorial Board, which endorsed Northam over the weekend, calls on him in todays paper to strongly condemn the despicable LVF ad: There is no question that if this were a race to the bottom, Mr. Gillespie would be the winner, having spent millions of dollars on ads that use specious claims and appeals to race and ethnicity to scare and divide.But just because Mr. Gillespie has resorted to gutter tactics doesnt give others leave to do the same.The Latino Victory Fund ad was vile.Among other faults, it glossed over the fact that Mr. Gillespie condemned the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville far more directly than did President Trump.-- If youre not following this race closely, The Washington Posts local political reporters have produced a steady stream of excellent reportage from across the commonwealth.Here are eight stories from the past week that will get you up to speed if you want to go deeper: -- A little more in the weeds: Both sides are breaking fundraising records.Gillespie raised $9.7 million between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26 while Northam pulled in nearly $11 million, according to fresh finance reports.Gillespie and Northam together raised almost twice what the gubernatorial contenders collected in the same period four years ago, per Fenit Nirappil.With 12 days before Election Day, Northam had $1.7 million left in campaign accounts to Gillespies $1.4 million.Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.Sign up to receive the newsletter.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant who was living in Tampa, allegedly drove a rental truck onto a Manhattan bike path on Tuesday, killing eight people and leaving at least a dozen others injured in what authorities have described as a terrorist attack.Around 3:05 p.m., a man driving a rented Home Depot pickup truck entered the West Side Highway bike path, striking bicyclists and pedestrians as he drove [southbound], Mark Berman, Devlin Barrett and Rachel Siegel report.The attacker collided with a bus, injuring two adults and two children inside.The assailant then exited the vehicle brandishing two handguns, [New York Police Commissioner James] ONeill said.A paintball gun and a pellet gun were later recovered at the scene.Saipov, 29, was shot and arrested by police shortly after the attack , and officers said Tuesday evening they were not seeking any other suspects., and officers said Tuesday evening they were not seeking any other suspects.Saipov brandished what turned out to be a pellet and paintball gun at the scene and some witnesses said he shouted Allahu akbar meaning God is great in Arabic.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described the attack as a painful day for our city.Based on the information we had at this moment, this was an act of terror, a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians, he said.Based on the information we had at this moment, this was an act of terror, a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians, he said.Trump vowed to provide full support to NYPD, including through a joint investigation with the FBI .He thanked the first responders who stopped the suspect and rendered immediate aid to the victims of this cowardly attack..He thanked the first responders who stopped the suspect and rendered immediate aid to the victims of this cowardly attack.Five Argentines were among the victims, part of a group celebrating their 30th high school graduation anniversary.Trump had a lot to say on the attack via Twitter last night and this morning.His latest tweet tied New York Sen. Chuck Schumer (D) to a visa program the president claimed the suspect entered the country on: The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 -- Our colleagues note: There was no immediate indication that the attack had been directed by the Islamic State.However, the group has called on its supporters in Western countries to launch their own attacks, using anything at hand as weapons, including vehicles.Inside the rental truck, investigators found a handwritten note in which Saipov had declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, according to officials.-- It was not entirely clear what vetting program Trump was referring to, Philip Rucker adds: Trump, who has long advocated tougher screening of immigrants and other policies designed to prevent terrorism in the United States, did not specify which vetting program he was referring to or how it would change under his Tuesday order.White House officials had no immediate comment to explain the president's tweet.It appeared Trump was referring to the U.S. government's vetting programs for foreign nationals, as opposed to his controversial travel ban, which affected only a handful of majority-Muslim nations.Los Angeles Dodgers batter Chris Taylor hits a game-tying double against the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the World Series.(Adam Davis/European Pressphoto Agency/EFE/REX/Shutterstock) -- The Dodgers beat the Astros 3-1, forcing Game 7 in an already legendary World Series.Dave Sheinin writes: This World Series had defied predictions, upended convention and left nothing that could be counted upon aces crumbling, relievers burned to a crisp, no lead safe.The [Dodgers] great [Kenley] Jansen, big, burly and bearded, had himself blown a save, taken a loss and, in the face of a relentless Houston Astros offense, generally appeared a shell of his dominating 2017 self.He needed six outs to carry home a two-run Dodgers lead.A crowd of 54,128 had the same thought: Was it too much to ask?But the outs came with the sort of ease with which they came in those languid days of April and June.One, two, three, four, five, six with nary a stumble.Jansen had a six-out save, the Dodgers had a taut 3-1 win, and the World Series this crazy, inspired, never-ending World Series will have a Game 7.After all the madness that has transpired over these past six games, it was only fitting.Rep.

Hsu reports: A U.S. magistrate on Monday put the men on home confinement [but prosecutors argued] that they pose a risk of flight based on a history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the evidence against them, and their wealth and foreign connections.The incentive to flee is even stronger for a defendant such as Manafort, who is in his late 60s, the government observed, noting that he faces a recommended sentence of about 12 to 15 years in prison if convicted, and Gates 10 to 12 years, not counting related frauds.-- The newly unsealed court filings allege both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs who have provided them with millions of dollars.Business Insiders Natasha Bertrand reports: Foreign connections of this kind indicate that the defendants would have access to funds and an ability 'to live comfortably' abroad ...a consideration that strongly suggests risk of flight, the filings said.Additionally, Manafort allegedly registered a phone number and email address using an alias, according to the government.He traveled with that phone to Mexico in June 2017; to China on May 23, 2017; and to Ecuador on May 9, 2017.-- Meanwhile, the U.S. District Court unsealed a little-noticed court filing revealing Mueller compelled Manaforts former lawyer to provide evidence against him.The aggressive tactic could have major consequences for other targets in the probe, should Mueller's team choose to use it again.Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: Typically, such information is protected by attorney-client privilege [but] there are some exceptions to that confidentiality, including in instances where a suspect may have lied to his or her lawyer, causing that lawyer to unwittingly lie to the government.In Manaforts case, prosecutors used information from his former lawyer to charge him with lying to the government about his work for a foreign government Ukraine.While most of the indictment focuses on issues of alleged money laundering, conspiracy and failure to file reports to tax authorities, the last two counts of the indictment say that Manafort and Gates knowingly and willfully caused to be made a false statement in a [FARA filing].Court filings suggest those two charges stem in part from information provided by Manaforts former lawyer[.][Peter D. Hardy, a partner at the Ballard Spahr law firm], said the use of what lawyers call the crime-fraud exception indicates the special counsel team is highly intelligent, highly aggressive, and theyre going to pursue legal theories that your average prosecutor will not use.Will they use the specific theory again?Its certainly possible.-- The New York Timess Matt Flegenheimer profiles Andrew Weissmann, a member of Muellers legal team who became known for flipping witnesses while chasing down mafia leaders: Weissmann is an expert in converting defendants into collaborators with either tactical brilliance or overzealousness, depending on ones perspective.Im no fan of Donald Trump, said Dan Cogdell, a Houston defense lawyer who tangled with Mr. Weissmann when Mr. Weissmann helped lead the federal task force investigating Enron in the early 2000s.Frankly, I cant think of two people who deserve each other more than Andrew Weissmann and Donald Trump.If Mr. Mueller is the stern-eyed public face of the investigation, Mr. Weissmann, 59, is its pounding heart, a bookish, legal pit bull with two Ivy League degrees, a weakness for gin martinis and classical music and a list of past enemies that includes professional killers and white-collar criminals.WHO IS GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS?: -- Trump's team dismissed former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Tuesday as a low level volunteer.But interviews and documents show Papadopoulos was in contact with the most senior officials of Trumps campaign and traveled the globe to meet with foreign officials and reporters while holding himself out as a Trump surrogate.Rosalind S. Helderman, Karen DeYoung and Tom Hamburger report: Papadopoulos sat at the elbow of [Jeff Sessions] during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention ...He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office, where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government.And he conferred at one point with the foreign minister of Greece at a meeting in New York.Three key details from the deep-dive into the man who could become key to the probe: At a March 31 meeting attended by both Sessions and Trump, Papadopoulos raised the idea of organizing a meeting with [Vladimir] Putin, telling attendees he had connections that could help facilitate the sit-down.The next month, he told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner.He was counseled to keep a low profile shortly afterward and yet, our colleagues report, he still continued to be invited to campaign events.In late June or early July, he attended a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club along with several other national security advisers for the Trump campaign[.]Papadopoulos was seated to Sessionss left .The next month, he told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner.He was counseled to keep a low profile shortly afterward and yet, our colleagues report, he still continued to be invited to campaign events.In late June or early July, he attended a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club along with several other national security advisers for the Trump campaign[.].Media appearances also continued.In September, he spoke extensively to Interfax, telling the Russian news agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations He also questioned the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Russia[.]He forwarded a copy of the article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign.In September, he spoke extensively to Interfax, telling the Russian news agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations He also questioned the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Russia[.]He forwarded a copy of the article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign.And Papadopoulos continued to hold himself out as a Trump adviser after the election.Two days after Trumps inauguration in January, he met in Washington with a group of Israelis headed by Yossi Dagan, a leader of the West Bank settler movement that prepared a video of the session to be shown at home.-- One week before the Republican convention, Papadopoulos told his Russia contact in an email that Trumps campaign approved a pre-election meeting with Putin representatives.Bloombergs Greg Farrell, David Voreacos and Henry Meyer report: This latest email, one of many unsealed on Monday, runs counter to the steadfast denials by Trump and his supporters that anyone attempted to work with the Russians.Prosecutors didnt explain why the email wasnt included in the detailed admissions of Papadopouloss wrongdoing, and its possible they concluded the assertions werent true.[In the email], Papadopoulos proposed a meeting for August or September in the U.K. that would include my national chairman and maybe one other foreign policy adviser and members of Putins office and Russias foreign ministry.-- The professor who promised Papadopoulos dirt on Hillary Clinton reportedly bragged to associates of his influential Russian contacts.Karla Adam, Jonathan Krohn and Griff Witte report: [I]n private exchanges, Joseph Mifsud was proud of his alleged high-level Moscow contacts, reporting that they had extended all the way to the top: Hed had, he told a former assistant late last year, a private meeting with [Putin].Whether Mifsud really had the sort of Kremlin contacts that Papadopoulos claims he advertised is unknown....Mifsud, who is in his mid-50s, insisted Tuesday that the claims embedded in the court documents are exaggerated[.]I have a clear conscience, Mifsud told Britains Daily Telegraph.-- Top Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis, who supervised Papadopoulos, spoke last week to Muellers team and testified before the grand jury.NBC Newss Ken Dilanian and Mike Memoli report: Clovis, who is [Trump's] pick to be the Department of Agriculture's chief scientist, could not be reached for comment.His lawyer, Victoria Toensing, would neither confirm nor deny his interactions with the Mueller team.The court documents describe emails between Papadopoulos and an unnamed campaign supervisor later revealed to be Clovis.-- Meanwhile, Cloviss ties to the Russia investigation have renewed opposition to his USDA nomination.Lisa Rein reports: On Tuesday, several thousand scientists and researchers affiliated with two national organizations that have rallied against Cloviss nomination signed letters urging the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry not to confirm him, calling him unfit for the post.The former conservative radio talk-show host from Iowa was already a controversial choice[:] Clovis, who is not a trained scientist, is a climate change skeptic who has said protecting gay rights could lead to the legalization of pedophilia.In every aspect, Clovis falls far short of the standards demanded by the position, the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a one-page letter to the [committee] ...The letter had 3,100 signers.-- SMART TAKE: Steven L. Hall, the retired CIA chief of Russia operations, says in a Post op-ed that Moscows outreach effort to Papadopoulos went just how spies would have done it.The Papadopoulos indictment tells a story containing several elements consistent with how Russian intelligence (and in this case, most likely the SVR) operates, Hall says.[From] a counterintelligence standpoint, a sound case can be made that the identification and slow courting of Papadopoulos by the Russians, initially using a professor with Russian government contacts to arrange foreign policy meetings, then later morphing into a mechanism to share damaging information on Clinton, was part of Russias larger 2016 operation.However, like most good Russian operations, this one built a strong element of deniability into the construct.-- The dominoes: White House communications director Hope Hicks is reportedly scheduled to sit down with Mueller later this month.Politicos Annie Karni and Josh Dawsey report: Muellers team already has interviewed former aides, including Trumps first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and former press secretary Sean Spicer.But the latest round of interviews appears to mark a new phase of the investigation hauling in current administration officials for day-long depositions.Hicks, 28, one of only a few aides who has been at Trumps side and in the room since before he launched his presidential campaign, has long been expected to be called as a witness.President Trump and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/ Win McNamee/Getty Images) TRUMP VS. MUELLER: -- The clashing dispositions of Trump and Mueller have become a palpable part of the Russia investigation, Greg Miller writes.Trump has often treated the probe as a political assault to be met with counterattacks in both public and private, rather than a legal minefield to be navigated carefully.Mueller, by contrast, has been silently methodical.He has not uttered a single word in public, works from an undisclosed location in Southwest Washington and demonstrated the same discipline and disdain for theatrics that defined his 12-year tenure as FBI director.Submarine-like in approach, Mueller has remained entirely below the surface except when delivering legal strikes[.]Muellers refusal to engage publicly sets him apart from other legal and political adversaries that Trump has encountered since his entry into politics.Trumps combative impulses are often most effective when he can draw opponents into a public skirmish 'Mueller is the opposite of Trump, the opposite of a showman, opposite of blustery, said Jack Goldsmith, who served as a senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration.Mueller is very quiet, very circumspect, very disciplined,' Goldsmith said.But he spoke very loudly and very powerfully through [Mondays indictments].THE POLITICS: -- This charges are threatening to derail Trumps standing with foreign leaders ahead of a key Asia trip this week, as well as his effectiveness in selling the Republican tax plan.John Wagner and David Nakamura report: Foreign policy analysts said Trumps political crisis could distract from or complicate his message on a high-stakes 12-day trip to five Asian nations aimed at building regional support for his bid to pressure North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.Unlike past U.S. leaders who have tried to stay on message in Asia Trump always wants to create a distraction, [Ian] Bremmer said.To what extent will he play harder ball with the Chinese or North Koreans or on trade?And, most importantly, will he decide to really fulminate against the North Koreans?It is dangerous, the combination of all that.In interviews, several prominent Republicans argued that the tax bill will rise or fall based on factors unrelated to Trumps level of distraction.[But] other observers suggested the pervasiveness of the Russia probe will have a more significant impact on Capitol Hill, particularly if more indictments are handed down in coming weeks.-- Trump attorney Jay Sekulow again sought to downplay the possibility that Trump would fire Mueller, saying that The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he's had any intent on terminating [Mueller].He added: You could only terminate a special counsel for cause, and we just don't see any basis for cause.That second part is significant, The Fixs Aaron Blake notes.'For cause means Mueller would have to actually have done something in his investigation to warrant being fired.Sekulow admits there isn't anything right now.And that's significant.Trump has hinted before that Mueller going after his and his family's finances might be a red line in the whole Russia investigation [and] the indictments of Manafort and [Gates] are pretty much all about their personal finances ...Sekulow has now said that this is fair game.He has essentially given his blessing to Mueller expanding his investigation into personal finances separate from the campaign.The White House has also said that pardons are not on the table.-- BUT: Some of Trump's advisers have stepped up their efforts to convince the president to go after Mueller.Philip Rucker and Robert Costa report: ...several prominent Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have said they think the presidents posture is too timid.Seeing the investigation as a political threat, they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its funding.Still, Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller, a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under consideration.-- Several Republican senators SAID they would not support efforts to cut funding for Muellers probe or otherwise curtail it.(Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan) -- Trumps pick to lead the Justice Departments national security division also said in his confirmation hearing yesterday that he would fully cooperate with the congressional Russia probes.(Ellen Nakashima) -- But Greg Sargent, one of the Post's liberal writers, argues the president and his allies are laying the groundwork for a Saturday Night Massacre, similar to when Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during Watergate.Lets be clear on whats happening in our politics right now.President Trump and his media allies are currently creating a vast, multi-tentacled, largely-fictional alternate media reality that casts large swaths of our government as irredeemably corrupt with the explicitly declared purpose of laying the rationale for Trump to pardon his close associates or shut down the Russia probe, should he deem either necessary.-- On Twitter, Trump tried to keep the focus on Tony Podesta's decision to step down from his lobbying firm: The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm.What he know about Crooked Dems is....

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 Tony's brother John Podesta, former chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign, responded to Trump's attacks: Not bad enough that I was the victim of a massive cyber crime directed by the Russian President (1/3) John Podesta (@johnpodesta) October 31, 2017 Now Im the victim of a big lie campaign by the American President (2/3) John Podesta (@johnpodesta) October 31, 2017 HOW IT'S PLAYING: -- Some employees at Fox News were embarrassed by their networks coverage of the Indictments Monday, calling it a another blow to journalists [there] who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way.CNNMoneys Oliver Darcy reports: 'I'm watching now and screaming, one Fox News personality said[.]I want to quit.[Another said] there were many eye rolls in the newsroom over how the news was covered.The person said, Fox feels like an extension of the Trump White House.Journalists there expressed particular frustration with the networks opinion hosts, including Sean Hannity, who characterized Muellers probe as a witch hunt."That segment on Outnumbered [questioning Mueller's integrity] was absurd and deserves all the scorn it can get," another employee said.-- But distortions weren't limited to Fox News, the New York Timess Jim Rutenberg writes.The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by [Rupert] Murdoch who has close ties to the presidents family and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp. [O]n Saturday, The New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin called for Mr. Muellers resignation, citing Fusion GPS as well as Mr. Muellers previous job as an F.B.I.director under President Barack Obama, given that, in Mr. Goodwins view, so much of the investigative focus must now fall on Mr. Obamas administration.Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwins dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller lacks the critical distance to look into the allegation that Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.WHY IT MATTERS: Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, theres a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election.So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.THERES A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- A Senate hearing yesterday with representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Google turned contentious at moments, as lawmakers questioned the companies ability to crack down on misinformation campaigns.Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Hamza Shaban report: With the threat of regulation looming, lawyers for the companies took pains to appear accommodating as they faced a host of questions about their businesses, their role in democratic societies, their efforts to be transparent and their ability to clamp down on malicious and nefarious content in past and future elections.They said that they were pouring significant new resources into combating foreign meddling but fell short of endorsing proposed legislation that would hold technology companies that publish political ads to the same disclosure standards as television and radio broadcasters.The most tense exchanges took place when the companies were asked to explain more about what their services can and cant do and what capabilities they have to prevent abuse.Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.)challenged [Facebook General Counsel Colin] Stretch with pointed questions.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, Kennedy said.You have 5 million advertisers that change every year, every month, probably every second ...You do not have the ability to know about every one of those advertisers, do you?-- And new details have underlined the extent of Russias social media reach during the election: Thousands of demonstrators attended a New York City protest organized by a Russian Facebook group.The Hills Ali Breland reports: The demonstration in New York City, which took place a few days after the election, appears to be the largest and most successful known effort to date pulled off by Russian-linked groups intent on using social media platforms to influence American politics.Sixteen thousand Facebook users said that they planned to attend a Trump protest on Nov. 12, 2016, organized by the Facebook page for BlackMattersUS, a Russian-linked group that sought to capitalize on racial tensions between black and white Americans.The event was shared with 61,000 users.As many as 5,000 to 10,000 protesters actually convened at Manhattan's Union Square.They then marched to Trump Tower, according to media reports at the time.The Hills Ali Breland reports: The demonstration in New York City, which took place a few days after the election, appears to be the largest and most successful known effort to date pulled off by Russian-linked groups intent on using social media platforms to influence American politics.Sixteen thousand Facebook users said that they planned to attend a Trump protest on Nov. 12, 2016, organized by the Facebook page for BlackMattersUS, a Russian-linked group that sought to capitalize on racial tensions between black and white Americans.The event was shared with 61,000 users.As many as 5,000 to 10,000 protesters actually convened at Manhattan's Union Square.They then marched to Trump Tower, according to media reports at the time.Some Russian accounts called for violence against groups including police officers, Black Lives Matters and undocumented immigrants.CNNs Curt Devine reports: Posts from three now-removed Facebook groups created by the Russian Internet Research Agency suggest Russia sought not only to meddle in U.S. politics but to encourage ideologically opposed groups to act out violently against one another....For example, Being Patriotic, a group that regularly posted content praising Donald Trump's candidacy, stated in an April 2016 post that Black Lives Matter activists who disrespected the American flag should be be immediately shot.The account accrued about 200,000 followers before it was shut down.GOP TAX PLAN DELAYED: -- House Republicans have delayed the release of their tax overhaul bill to tomorrow, potentially signaling trouble for its passage.The New York Timess Jim Tankersley, Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport report: After a day of negotiations on Capitol Hill and confusion across Washington, the Houses chief tax writer acknowledged the delay but vowed to stay on track with an ambitious plan to pass a bill through the chamber by Thanksgiving.Even if the delay does not throw the Republican schedule off course, it signals potential difficulties ahead for a bill that Republicans are attempting to pass on a party-line basis, over what appear most likely to be loud objections from some business groups and relentless criticism from Democrats.New details of the bill emerged: [Paul Ryan] told conservative groups on Tuesday afternoon that the draft bill would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent immediately, and not phase it in over a period of years, as had been discussed, according to a meeting attendee.Attendees were also told by Mr. Ryan that Republicans would phase in a full repeal of the estate tax over several years.-- But GOP leadership appeared to back off a plan to lower the top tax rate for the very wealthy.Damian Paletta and Mike DeBonis report: GOP leaders had planned to collapse the seven existing income tax brackets into three brackets, lowering the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, but now will retain the top bracket for people earning more than a certain threshold, perhaps $1,000,000[.]The decision to preserve a top rate signals that Republicans are eager to avoid the impression that their plan seeks only to reward wealthy Americans and corporations.And the move could attract the support of more moderate Republicans.They also will propose changes to tax-protected retirement savings plans, such as 401(k)s, in an effort to raise revenue.But [House Ways and Means Chairman Rep.

Lee was an honorable man, Kelly told host Laura Ingraham.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state ...But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.That statement could have been given by [former Confederate general] Jubal Early in 1880, said Columbia University history professor Stephanie McCurry.I mean, it tracks all of the major talking points of this pro-Confederate view of the Civil War.said Columbia University history professor Stephanie McCurry.I mean, it tracks all of the major talking points of this pro-Confederate view of the Civil War.This is profound ignorance at least of pretty basic things about the American historical narrative, Yale history professor David Blight said.I mean, its one thing to hear it from Trump, who, lets be honest, just really doesnt know any history and has demonstrated it over and over and over.But General Kelly has a long history in the American military.-- White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Kellys remarks, noting, All of our leaders have flaws.She went on, Washington, Jefferson, JFK, Roosevelt, Kennedy.That doesn't diminish their contributions to our country.It certainly can't erase them from our history.And General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn't perfect doesn't mean it's not our history.(Aaron Blake) -- Sanders's briefing concluded on this unbelievable note: Where we're at: Sarah Sanders leaves lectern to shouts from @AprilDRyan: "Sarah, was slavery wrong?"David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) October 31, 2017 -- The controversy marked the second time in as many weeks that the White House was forced to justify Kellys words, unraveling the idea that his presence provides order.Greg Jaffe and Anne Gearan report: He violated the first basic rule of the chief of staff, which is not to make yourself the news of the day, said former defense secretary Leon E.

Lots of Americans don’t think slavery caused the Civil War:::::White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly (Agence France-Presse/Getty Images) White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly is embroiled in a new controversy stemming from his remarks about the Civil War.Asked about the potential removal of plaques honoring Robert E. Lee and George Washington in a Virginia church, Kelly said: I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now its different today.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.This statement elicited considerable dismay from historians, who believe that he downplayed the real cause of the war: slavery.One explanation for Kellys remarks is they reflect the views of military officers but not necessarily ordinary Americans.As the Posts Greg Jaffe and Anne Gearan reported: Other military officials described Kellys remarks as the product of a somewhat cloistered view of the conflict inculcated in military officers, but not necessarily shared by the broader public.In fact, Kellys views are shared by a substantial fraction of the broader public.Consider this graph, which was compiled by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research from 2011 polls conducted around the Civil Wars 150th anniversary: With one exception these polls found more Americans cited states rights than slavery as the Civil Wars main cause.Even the exception in which 42 percent said slavery was not the main reason still shows many Americans take a position not dissimilar from Kellys.A more recent poll shows the same thing.In July 2015, a McClatchy-Marist poll asked Was slavery the main reason for the Civil War, or not?Just over half (53 percent) said it was, while 41 percent said it was not.Among Republicans, opinion was more narrowly divided: 49 percent yes and 45 percent no.In short, large pluralities and even majorities of Americans do not believe the Civil War was primarily about slavery.So for Kelly to downplay slaverys role clearly rejects the actual history, but it doesnt make him a cloistered military officer with a fringe view.To many Americans, his view will seem entirely conventional.
Top Mnuchin aide’s private jet flight to Palm Beach was legal, but legal ‘does not always equate to wise,’ watchdog finds:::::Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Capitol Hill (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) On his way to lunch with President Trump at the White House on a Thursday in March, a major GOP political contributor and hedge fund billionaire named Nelson Peltz stopped by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins office to say hello to him and his chief of staff, Eli Miller.Miller mentioned to Peltz that he was flying to Palm Beach, Fla., that night to visit his in-laws.Peltz said he was traveling there, too, and offered him a ride in his private jet.After getting a green light from Treasurys ethics official, Miller accepted the ride, working and emailing on the flight while Peltz slept.[Hedge fund billionaire flew top Mnuchin aide on private jet to Palm Beach] With a slew of senior Trump administration officials under scrutiny for their use of luxury air travel, the propriety of this trip came under investigation by the Treasury Departments inspector general.His conclusion: The flight to Florida was a perfectly legal gift, since the chief of staff and the hedge fund billionaire have been friends since they met on the Trump campaign and no Treasury business was discussed.But in an environment where many actions by Trump administration officials are under the microscope, just because its legal doesnt mean the optics are good, the watchdogs office warned.The applicable regulations do stress that legal does not always equate to appropriate or wise, Rich Delmar, counsel to Inspector General Eric Thorson, wrote in a nine-page review of the case released Tuesday and launched after The Washington Post reported on the trip in October.[Treasury Secretarys flights totaling $811,000 were legal but poorly justified, watchdog says] Peltz, a founding partner of New York-based Trian Fund Management, has praised the presidents plan to slash tax rates on businesses and the wealthy, a plan largely designed by senior Treasury officials.Delmar found no evidence that Peltz offered to fly Miller on his private jet to influence tax policy or other Treasury policy, though.The men are friends who communicate by phone, emails and text messages and occasional meetings about twice a month.Miller sees Peltz as a mentor, Delmar wrote.Peltz also personally paid for the flight and did not expense it to his business, further distancing his gift from questions about conflicts of interest.Members of President Trump's Cabinet have been taking noncommercial flights at the expense of taxpayers, and Trump says he's "not happy."(Monica Akhtar/TWP) The facts [Miller] presented regarding how he knows Mr. Peltz do appear consistent with the regulations definition of a personal relationship, in that while it arose from the political campaign and involved the current Secretary, it appears to have been conducted outside of official channels and topics, Delmar wrote.Delmar noted that there is no evidence that Mr. Peltzs access to Treasury officials would be enhanced by his offer, and Mr. Millers acceptance, of the plane ride.Mr. Peltz knows Mr. Miller, and indeed the Secretary and the President, already.He concluded that Mr. Millers acceptance of the aircraft ride does not appear to have violated applicable law and regulation.But he urged caution:
President Trump’s tax cut: Not ‘the biggest’ in U.S. history:::::The president has a habit of exaggerating; this time his exaggeration is the size of his proposed tax cut.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!President Trump, in a tweet, Oct. 20, 2017 More than 20 times since he became president, President Trump has claimed that the tax plan under consideration in Congress was the largest tax cut in the history of the United States.He made this claim even before many details were set, but from the beginning it was nonsense.It was so easily debunked that we just tossed it in our ongoing database of false and misleading Trump claims, rather than do a full-fledged fact check.On occasion, the White House has suggested Trump is talking only about the corporate-tax component of the tax plan.But thats never how the president himself frames it.So we have to examine his claim as he states it.Now that the House and Senate have approved the parameters of the tax cut $1.5 trillion over 10 years we have numbers we can evaluate.So, for the record, heres how his plan stacks up assuming it actually gets passed into law.The Facts The best way to compare tax cuts (or spending plans) over time is to measure them as a percentage of the national economy.Inflation-adjusted dollars are another option, but a percentage of gross domestic product helps put the impact of the bill into context.The Treasury Department has regularly compared tax cuts and increases using both methods, most recently in 2013.The Treasury analysis goes back to 1940, using either the first year of the tax legislation for tax bills between 1940 and 1968 or a four-year average of the bills between 1968 and 2012.The budget blueprint approved by Republicans indicates that tax cut would reduce revenue by $167 billion in 2018; it also averages out to $167 billion a year in the first four years.Well use a gross domestic product of $19.5 trillion in 2018, which assumes the kind of growth Trump expects.That means the tax cut would be nearly 0.9 percent of GDP.Compare that to: Economic Recovery Act of 1981 (Reagan): 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 (Truman): 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 (Truman): 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Obama): 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 (Johnson): 1.6 percent Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2010 (Obama): 1.31 percent In other words, Trumps tax cut would even be smaller than two tax cuts passed by Congress under President Barack Obama.Were sure that must be a source of irritation.In fact, Trumps tax cut would even fall behind Obamas tax cuts when measured by inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Heres a useful chart put together by CRFB, which labels the Trump tax cut as Framework.The group also included an estimate for a 1921 tax cut from a 2012 paper by Christina Romer and David Romer.The Pinocchio Test We realize that the president often likes to say biggest or best, but his claim about the tax plan is embarrassing flimflam.He needs to drop this talking point.Saying it over and over does not make it so.Four Pinocchios (About our rating scale) Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trumps promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter Fact Checker User Poll Voting is closed on this poll User Poll Results: Do you rate this claim as true or false?More Pinocchios for false, fewer based on your opinion of the statement's truthfulness.(The check mark means you think the statement is true, not that you agree with the rating.)20% 20% 20% 20% 20% Pardon the interruption!We need to verify that you are an actual person.View Results This is a non-scientific user poll.Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general population.
What Paul Ryan can learn from John Boehner’s ‘tell-all’ interview:::::Then-House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) talks with reporters on Capitol Hill in October 2015.(Lauren Victoria Burke/AP) The Beltway crowd has been abuzz over the recent Politico story about former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).Over the course of several interviews, Boehner speaks candidly about the reasons he abruptly resigned from the House and offers blunt assessments of President Trump, Barack Obama and members of Congress from both parties.Hidden among the can-you-believe-he-said-that quotes are some valuable insights into the politics of the modern speakership.Lets look at how Boehners interview illuminates the challenges facing his successor, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), and what may be in store for Ryans relationship with the Trump White House.[Watch out, Republicans.Tax reform could be just as hard as healthcare.]1.Speakers of the House are usually institutionalists.In my book about the speakership, I argue that speakers are motivated in part to serve the institutional interests of the House (which can include the office of speaker).As the article makes clear, Boehner was no exception.For instance, in July 2015 conservative dissenter Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) filed a motion to vacate the chair, which if approved would have removed Boehner as speaker.But Boehner decided to resign instead, partly because a vote on the motion, in his words, would be awful for the institution.If Ryan is an institutionalist as well, he might also resign if faced with a motion to vacate the chair.Its more likely, though, that well see his institutionalism reveal in other ways pushing back if, for instance, Trump interferes too deeply in congressional affairs.2.Speakers rarely remain popular.Being speaker is a surefire way to become disliked.As Paul Kane recently documented, Ryans approval ratings have sunk since he was elected to the position.The same happened to Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during her term as speaker.Boehner faced an identical fate: Not just Democrats but even conservative voters disliked him.Why?Kane suggests it may be because of negative advertising by the opposing party, but the causes are probably deeper.The speaker operates in a polarized political environment, is the public face of a perpetually unpopular Congress, and makes decisions that people from both parties are bound to dislike.As Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told Kane, Id rather be in Gitmo than do that [job] all day.3.Speakers are expected to take flak for their party, even if it proves fatal.Speakers follow a core unwritten rule of leadership: Protect your fellow partisans.Unfortunately, as Boehners case reveals, taking too much flak can make a speaker so unpopular that he becomes politically vulnerable.For Boehner, who was planning to retire anyway, avoiding the floor vote on the motion to vacate the chair by resigning early protected other Republicans from publicly endorsing a speaker whom their base disliked.All these Republicans were going to get crap at home for supporting me, as he puts it, only to have me leave soon after that.[Republicans are the party of ideological inconsistency] Ryan is undoubtedly aware of this expectation, which challenges his tenure as it did Boehners.But it also has implications for how hell deal with an unpopular White House.Ryan has already shown he will distance himself from Trump if he thinks it will help his colleagues get reelected.4.Speaker of the House is not a secure job.The office of speaker was once held until death or retirement.No longer.As I have noted elsewhere, every speaker since 1987 has either resigned, as did Boehner, Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Jim Wright (D-Tex.); lost reelection to the House, the fate that befell Tom Foley (D-Wash.); or lost their party majority, as happened to Pelosi and Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).Given the positions unpopularity and flak-taking responsibilities, this should come as little surprise.But there other forces at work, too.These include greater party competition, which make majorities less secure, and more assertive factions within the majority party, willing to openly challenge the speaker a phenomenon that has plagued House Republicans in particular since 2010.[This is why the Congressional budget process is broken] If Ryan, like Boehner, is forced to step down before hes ready, he can at least look to his predecessor for inspiration.Playing golf and sipping merlot is not a bad way to spend ones retirement.Matthew Green is a professor of politics at Catholic University.His most recent book is Underdog Politics: The Minority Party in the U.S. House of Representatives.(Yale University Press, 2015).
President Trump’s claim that he ‘turned West Virginia around’ by cutting regulations on mining:::::President Trump has a habit of claim economic achievements that aren't connected to his policies.This claim adds to that list.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) And Ive turned West Virginia around, because of what Ive done environmentally with coal.And I dont know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP.President Trump, remarks during an interview on Fox News Radio, Oct. 17 One thing that I am very proud of, the state of West Virginia.Last month, it was one of the highest percentage increases in GDP, the state of Texas beat it.And people are saying, wait a minute, West Virginia just came in second.Do you know what that is about?That is about cutting regulations and letting the people go and mine.President Trump, remarks during an interview with Sean Hannity, Oct. 11 President Trump has repeatedly taken credit for economic improvements and business deals that have little to do with his policies.Regular readers may recall that we gave him Two Pinocchios for his claim that he personally added 1 million jobs, and Four Pinocchios for taking credit for Foxconns proposed plant in Wisconsin.Now Trump is at it again.He claims he has turned West Virginia around by cutting regulations and letting people go mine.Since taking office, Trump has cut several Obama-era regulations on mining and energy production.And in the first quarter of 2017, West Virginia, a major energy-producing state, saw a 3 percent increase in gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy.So, is there a connection between Trumps actions and West Virginias economy?Lets take a look.The Facts Trumps energy regulations Trump claims he has cut more regulations than any other president in history, which weve pointed out is difficult to verify, but when it comes to the environment he seems to be hard at work toward this goal.Here are a few of the regulations he has attempted to undo: In February, Congress voted to repeal the stream protection rule, which restricts mining companies from dumping wastewater and debris into nearby waterways.On Feb. 16, Trump signed the bill, officially ending the protections.In March 2017, the Interior Department planned to rescind a 2015 rule regulating fracking on public lands.On July 25, the Bureau of Land Management submitted its new proposal to the Federal Register.On March 28, Trump signed an executive order promoting energy independence and economic growth, instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to pursue repealing the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administrations signature policy to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from domestic electricity production.On Oct. 9, Scott Pruitt announced the EPAs intention to repeal the plan, and on Oct. 16, the EPA published the full proposal for the repeal in the Federal Register.On April 28, Trump signed an executive order expanding offshore drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.In August 2017, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released a report on states GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017.Across the country, mining grew 21.6 percent, spurring growth in 48 of the 50 states.The BEA notes that the growth in mining was the leading contributor to growth in the three fastest-growing states Texas, West Virginia, and New Mexico, which grew 3.9 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.7 percent, respectively.The fact that West Virginia saw a 3 percent increase after years of limited growth was not lost on Trump.In two interviews on Fox News programs, he touted the states economic growth, adding that it was a result of his elimination of regulatory policies on mining and coal.Is the credit deserved?The short answer is, no.For starters, the first quarter ended on March 31, 2017, just two months after Trump took office.And even though he wasted no time rolling back Obama-era protections, many of his newly loosened regulations on mining and coal havent gone into effect.The comment period on the administrations proposal to open fracking on public lands closed Sept. 25, and the BLM now has to review the 459 public comments on the proposal as it drafts the final rule.Once the final rule is published in the register, it typically goes into effect within 30 days of publication.Likewise, the administrations repeal of the Clean Power Plan has yet to take effect.Pruitt claimed in October that he was ending the war on coal, by rescinding the Clean Power Plan, but the agencys proposal is up for public comment until December.More importantly, the regulations proposed by the Obama administration have been on pause since February 2016, when the Supreme Court voted to stay the plan while it considers whether the administration exceeded its authority to regulate air pollution under the Clean Air Act.When Trump signed the law repealing the stream protection rule, the provision had been in effect only since Jan. 19, 2017 a mere 28 days.In a January 2017 impact analysis of the Obama-era rule, the Congressional Research Service estimated it would take up to 42 months for states to implement the federal rules.Repealing a law that wasnt widely implemented would do little in the short term to increase growth in the industry.And, finally, increased drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans has no bearing on West Virginia.How West Virginia got to 3 percent West Virginia is the second-largest coal producer in the country, and in 2016 it accounted for 11 percent of the total coal production in the United States.The state is also the ninth-largest producer of natural gas in the country, with an estimated 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas extracted in 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration.While most of the economic growth in West Virginia is due to growth in these two industries, the boost can be attributed to rising productivity and prices.According to the BEA, in West Virginia, mining grew 26.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, and data from EIA shows gains in the extraction of coal, natural gas, and petroleum bolstered mining in the state.The primary driver of the states increased coal production is a surge in Asia-Pacific metallurgical coal demand as well as a temporary boost in demand from Australia after Cyclone Debbie damaged the countrys rail infrastructure, according to a report on the states economic outlook by West Virginia University.The increase in extraction coincided with an increase in the price of metallurgical coal and natural gas.In the first quarter of 2017, the price of metallurgical coal exports was $153 per short ton, up from $76 in the third quarter of 2016.For the first nine months of 2017, the price of natural gas was $3 per million British thermal units on average, up from a 2016 average of just under $2.50 per million BTUs.Another factor boosting West Virginias GDP is the states declining unemployment rate.From 2015 to 2017, the unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percent.Whether increased employment leads to economic growth is debated by economists, but historically, GDP has fallen as unemployment rises and vice versa.Unfortunately, the falling unemployment rate in West Virginia reflects the fact that thousands of people left the labor force altogether.Over the two-year period, the states unemployed population declined by roughly 13,500 people, but nearly 5,500 of those people simply stopped looking for work.Still, nearly 8,000 people went back to work in the state.Even though Trump claims he has turned West Virginia around, the trends arent expected to last.The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University estimated the states GDP growth to average 1.0 percent per year over the next five years and employment to grow 0.7 percent well below national projections.Additionally, the coal industry still has a way to go to recover from its losses.In 2008, the state produced nearly 158 million short tons of coal, and by 2016, that number had plummeted to 80 million, according to a report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research.John Deskins, co-author of the report and director of the bureau, cautioned that while increased coal production is projected to remain stable, the state still has a long road to economic recovery.West Virginia has no short-term solution for its economic problems, Deskins said.We need industrial diversification and investment in human capital.But with the states poor education system and really bad drug epidemic, the human capital gains are a major challenge.The Fact Checker documented these findings to the White House, seeking a response.But the White House declined to comment.The Pinocchio Test Trump takes credit for West Virginias economic gains, but its undeserved.For one, when the first quarter ended on March 31, 2017, Trump was just two months into his presidency.While he was quick to do away with several regulations on energy production, many of the new policies have yet to take effect.The states recent growth is due to increased mining production and a rise in prices for coal and natural gas.Taking credit for economic advances where no credit is due seems to be a habit for Trump.He should be more careful not to overstate the effect of his administrations policies when praising economic gains across the country.For trying to capitalize on the hard work of West Virginians, Trump earns Four Pinocchios.Four Pinocchios (About our rating

Trump says he ordered U.S. to ‘step up our already Extreme Vetting Program’:::::President Trump is pictured on the South Lawn of the White House on Sept. 29.(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) President Trump said Tuesday night that he has directed the government to step up its vetting program for foreign nationals after authorities said an Uzbek immigrant killed eight and injured 11 in a terrorist attack in Manhattan.Trump wrote in a tweet, I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 Trump, who has long advocated tougher screening of immigrants and other policies designed to prevent terrorism in the United States, did not specify which vetting program he was referring to or how it would change under his Tuesday order.White House officials had no immediate comment to explain the president's tweet.It appeared Trump was referring to the U.S. government's vetting programs for foreign nationals, as opposed to his controversial travel ban, which affected only a handful of majority-Muslim nations.Law enforcement officials identified the suspect in Tuesday's attack as Sayfullo Saipov, 29, an Uzbek immigrant who had lived in Tampa and New Jersey.Uzbekistan was not among the countries named in any version of Trump's travel ban.In a Monday interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly defined "extreme vetting" as verifying the identities of people traveling to the United States.Extreme vetting is, we simply interview people and have to satisfy ourselves that the person were talking to is indeed the person who they claim, Kelly, a former secretary of homeland security, told Ingraham.It might be impossible to do in some cases.Kelly added, If we can't verify, I don't think we should let them into the country.
Roy Moore tried to fit in with Senate Republicans for a day. It didn’t work.:::::Alabama Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Roy Moore speaks with reporters during a visit to the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Tuesday.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Roy Moore arrived in the Capitol to play an unfamiliar role: Republican conformist.By the time he left, he was once again a lightning rod for controversy.The hard-right former judge made his second trip to Washington on Tuesday as his partys Senate nominee in Alabama.Unlike the last time he was in town, Moore decided to mingle with the Republican establishment he has villainized on the campaign trail.He joined Republican senators at their weekly policy luncheon.Most backed his opponent in the primary.He chatted with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), his bitter foe.Afterward, he refrained from reiterating his criticism of the Kentuckian.Moore also dodged questions from reporters about incendiary statements he has made about a Muslim serving in Congress and gay people, declaring that he was not there to answer any questions about issues.Controversial conservative and former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore won the Republican primary for the state's Senate seat on Sept. 26, setting up a crisis within the GOP.Here's a look at three problems his win poses for the D.C. establishment.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) As he made the rounds, some of Moores potential future Republican colleagues strained to separate themselves from him.One even attacked him head-on in a speech on the Senate floor.The visit offered a preview of the headaches Moores presence could cause for Senate Republican leaders should he prevail in a Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.I dont know where Im going right now, Moore told reporters as he exited Tuesdays lunch and walked down a hallway near the Senate chamber before doubling back toward a bank of elevators.Asked by one reporter whether he still thinks Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) should not be a member of Congress because hes Muslim, as Moore wrote in a 2006 opinion piece, Moore replied, Ill address that later.Did he still think homosexual conduct should be illegal, as he said in a 2005 television interview?Im not answering any questions on issues right now, Moore said.He said he spoke at lunch to McConnell, whom he has vowed to oppose as leader.But as he departed the second floor of the Capitol, he said he was not going to give an opinion on that matter at that moment.Less than two hours later, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent critic of the far-right and President Trump who is retiring at the end of this Congress, used a floor speech in favor of a conservative judicial nominee to condemn Moore.When the presidential nominee of my party, the party of Lincoln, called for a Muslim ban, it was wrong, and I said so, said Flake.When a judge expressed his personal belief that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong.That this same judge is now my partys nominee for the Senate should concern us all.Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress.Moores visit came amid an effort by Senate Republicans to criticize Democrats for what they have charged was anti-Catholic animus against judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic law professor who has questioned the legal rationale behind the Supreme Court ruling on abortion in Roe v. Wade.The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Barrett to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.Republicans have focused on Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who accused Barrett at a hearing of letting dogma overwhelm legal reasoning, and then expanded to attacking any Democrat who opposed Barrett.But some of the same lawmakers lodging that complaint have not forcefully criticized Moores past comment about Ellison, adding awkwardness to their line of attack on the basis of religious liberty.For some Republican senators, Moores appearance on Tuesday also created some discomfort.Asked whether he supported Moore, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (S.D.)responded, Im hoping to meet with him while hes up here.I havent had a chance to do that yet.I dont know him.Like Trump and many other leading Republicans, Thune backed Sen. Luther Strange in the GOP primary that Moore won.He stood up and was pleasant in his comments, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), recalling Moores appearance at lunch.But Corker wasnt won over and he did not want to weigh in on Moores controversial positions.I plan on staying out of the election, and the people of Alabama will determine that, he said.And I have nothing to do whatsoever with whats happening in the Senate race in Alabama.Moore is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday evening.An invitation distributed by his campaign this month lists the names of prominent conservative activists and senators backing his campaign, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).But in a sign that Moore may not even be on the same page as some of his allies in Washington, a spokesman for Lee said Tuesday that it was not on the senators to-do list.Tomorrows fundraiser is not on our schedule, said the spokesman, Conn Carroll.
For ‘low level volunteer,’ Papadopoulos sought high profile as Trump adviser:::::George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in early October to lying to federal officials about his contacts with Russian nationals.He is one of three former Trump campaign officials facing criminal charges.(Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in early October to lying to federal officials about his contacts with Russian nationals.He is one of three former Trump campaign officials facing criminal charges.(Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) President Trump on Tuesday belittled former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty this week to lying to federal agents investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election, tweeting that few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.But interviews and documents show that Papadopoulos was in regular contact with the Trump campaigns most senior officials and held himself out as a Trump surrogate as he traveled the world to meet with foreign officials and reporters.Papadopoulos sat at the elbow of one of Trumps top campaign advisers, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention, according to an individual who attended the meeting.He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office, where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government.And he conferred at one point with the foreign minister of Greece at a meeting in New York.While some top campaign aides appeared to rebuff Papadopouloss persistent offers to broker a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, there is no sign they told him directly to cease his activities or sought to end his affiliation with the campaign.Emails included in court documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos repeatedly told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with people he believed were representing the Russian government.The court documents do not answer a key question: whether Papadopoulos also told his superiors that he had met a London-based professor who claimed to know that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including thousands of her emails.An FBI agent told the court in July that Papadopoulos lied in an interview with federal agents, saying he did not tell anyone on the campaign about the dirt because he thought the professor was a nothing.[Whos who in the George Papadopoulos court documents] At 29, Papadopoulos had scant experience that qualified him to advise a presidential candidate.He had entered the Trump campaign after a six-week stint working for the campaign of Trumps rival for the Republican nomination, neurosurgeon Ben Carson.Carsons campaign manager, Barry Bennett, recalled that Papadopoulos was hired after sending him an unsolicited message via LinkedIn seeking a job.At the time, Carsons campaign was desperate to show it had policy experts advising his campaign, given that most leading Republican foreign policy thinkers had been snapped up by other candidates.Bennett said his only vetting was to ask a friend at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, where Papadopouloss rsum indicated he had worked as a researcher, whether Papadopoulos was an okay guy.I wasnt looking for something stellar, Bennett said.I wanted to make sure he was okay.For six weeks of work, Bennett said, Papadopoulos was paid $8,500, before he was let go from the campaign at the end of January 2016 as it shed staff.By March 2016, Trumps campaign, like Carsons before it, was eagerly searching for foreign policy expertise.As Trump rose in the polls and won Republican primaries, the former reality TV host was under pressure to announce a group of advisers with whom he was consulting on foreign policy issues.The scrutiny intensified early that month after 70 conservative national security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy.In mid-March, Trump was asked on the MSNBC show Morning Joe to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs.Im speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain, Trump responded, prompting more calls for a list of formal advisers.To come up with names, the campaign turned to Sam Clovis, a former Iowa radio host who served as national campaign co-chairman, an attorney for Clovis confirmed Tuesday in a statement.But the statement did not address how Papadopoulos ended up on the list.Bennett said he was not consulted and would not have recommended his former employee if he had been asked because he found him unimpressive.On March 21, Trump included Papadopoulos among five men he announced were advising him on matters of national security in a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board.An energy and oil consultant.Excellent guy, Trump said.[Anyone ...with a pulse: How a Rdussia-friendly adviser found his way into the Trump campaign] If Trump or his team had undertaken even a cursory vetting of Papadopoulos, they would have found that much of his already-slim rsum was either exaggerated or false.While he claimed to have served for several years as a fellow at the Hudson Institute, officials there said he had been an unpaid intern and a researcher under contract to several fellows who were writing a book.Although he claimed to be U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations, officials at that organization said they had no record of him.Papadopoulos said he had delivered the keynote address at a leading American-Greek organization in 2008 while a student at DePaul University.But records from the gathering indicate he merely participated in a youth panel with other participants.The keynote was delivered by 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.Though Papadopouloss exaggerated rsum issues quickly became public, he remained a part of the Trump advisory panel and soon began urging campaign aides to let him set up a meeting between Trump and Russian officials.Court documents show he raised the idea at a March 31 meeting of the group attended by both Trump and Sessions, who had endorsed Trumps campaign, telling the group that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President [Vladimir] Putin.He also began appearing in the foreign press.While visiting Israel the next month, he told a group of researchers that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner, according to a column in the Jerusalem Post.In May, he told the Telegraph of London that Prime Minister David Cameron should apologize to Trump for calling the candidate divisive, stupid and wrong.Camerons comments had come after Trump announced that he supported a ban on Muslims entering the United States.Papadopouloss comments were big news in Britain and the campaign took notice.J.D.Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump national security adviser, said campaign officials were displeased, and Papadopoulos was counseled that he should clear future media appearances with campaign staff and keep a low profile.I was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign, he said Tuesday in a text message.He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Sen.Sessions.And yet, Papadopoulos continued to be invited to campaign events.In late June or early July, he attended a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club along with several other national security advisers for the Trump campaign.Another person who was at the meeting said Sessions also attended; Papadopoulos was seated to Sessionss left.A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment.Media appearances by Papadopoulos continued.In September, he spoke extensively to Interfax, telling the Russian news agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations, depending on Russia acting as a responsible stake holder in the international system.He also questioned the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Russia.By that time, WikiLeaks had released emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee that were widely suspected to have been stolen at the direction of the Russian government.Trumps warm rhetoric toward Putin had become a controversial topic on the campaign trail.Court documents show that Papadopoulos forwarded a copy of the Interfax article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign.[Timeline: How Papadopoulos tried to work with the Russian government] British sources said it was around that time that he approached British government officials to say he was traveling to London and asked to be given a meeting with senior government ministers.Instead, he was offered a session with a mid-level official at the Foreign Office in London.During the meeting, Papadopoulos made a comment indicating he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government, British sources said.British officials quickly concluded he was not a major or knowledgeable player in the Trump orbit and did not pursue the issue or continue contact.A spokesman for the Greek Embassy said he met with that nations foreign minister in New York.Spokesman Efthymios Aravantinos said the conversation was conducted as part of a routine effort that the embassy makes to reach out to Greek Americans hoping they have a sentimental attachment to Greece and that we can connect.It is not clear how much the campaign knew about Papadopouloss activities.But he continued through these months to have contact with other Trump officials.In September, Papadopoulos emailed another Trump aide, Boris Epshteyn, and told him he planned to be in New York and hoped to set up meetings around the U.N. General Assembly meeting.The email was described to The Washington Post in August of this year and is among 20,000 pages of documents that the Trump campaign has turned over to the White House, Congressional committees and defense attorneys.Papadopoulos wrote that he wanted to connect Epshteyn with a friend, Sergei Millian of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce, the emails said.Millian would later be identified as a major source for the author of a dossier that included unsubstantiated salacious allegations about Trumps activities in Russia, a claim Millian has denied.Epshteyn said he never met Millian and declined to comment further.Asked in August to describe his relationship with Papadopoulos, Millian responded by email, I can meet and talk to any person....Its none of your business.Millian did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.Papadopoulos continued to hold himself out as a Trump adviser, even after the November election.Two days after Trumps inauguration in January, he met in Washington with a group of Israelis headed by Yossi Dagan, a leader of the West Bank settler movement that prepared a video of the session to be shown at home.We had an excellent meeting with Yossi and we hope that the people of Judea and Samaria the name used by the Israeli right for the West Bank will have a great 2017, Papadopoulos said, according to the video.We are looking forward to ushering in a new relationship with all of Israel.According to an account in the Jerusalem Post, the settler leaders had been invited to attend the inauguration and meet with senators, congressmen and members of the Presidents team.Dagan, reached by telephone Tuesday in Israel, declined to comment on the visit or who had arranged the meeting with Papadopoulos.While the president now seems to have left Papadopoulos behind, Papadopoulos has continued to highlight the tie.On LinkedIn, he indicates he was a Trump adviser through January 2017 and includes the experience as the first line of his description about himself.President Trump recommendation about me: George is an oil and gas consultant; excellent guy, Papadopoulos wrote.karen.deyoung@washpost.com Dan Balz, Sari Horwitz and Devlin Barrett in Washington and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report.Read more: Three former Trump campaign officials charged by special counsel This is a nothing burger: How conservative media reacted to the Mueller indictments Upstairs at home, with the TV on, Trump fumes over Russia indictments

Trump resists mounting pressure from Bannon and others to fight Mueller:::::Former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon called congressional Republicans church mice for what he sees as their timid response to the Mueller investigation.(Mary F. Calvert/Reuters) Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges against three former Trump campaign officials.Despite his growing frustration with a federal probe he has roundly dismissed, Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly, at the urging of his attorneys inside and outside the White House.But several prominent Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have said they think the presidents posture is too timid.Seeing the investigation as a political threat, they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its funding.Still, Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller, a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under consideration.Bannon in recent days has spoken with Trump by phone to relay his concerns about the presidents position and to counsel a shift in strategy, according to three people with knowledge of the conversation.The president so far has not accepted Bannons advice, these people said.President Trump has been cooperating with the Mueller probe, on the advice of lawyers inside and outside the White House.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Bannons view has been amplified elsewhere on the right, with talk radio and cable news commentators speaking out more forcefully against Mueller and his expanding probe.The Wall Street Journal editorial board has called on Mueller to resign.The Journal is part of News Corp., which is led by Rupert Murdoch, a friend of Trump who speaks privately with the president.But many people in Trumps orbit recommend that he stay the course with cooperation encouraging him to harshly criticize media coverage of the investigation but avoid engaging Mueller.I like Steve, but his advice is not always the most helpful, said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of Newsmax, a conservative media outlet.In this case, whatever Steve says, the president should do the opposite.[Three former Trump campaign officials charged by special counsel] The tensions extend to Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers have mostly split into two camps: those who are wary of weighing in on Muellers investigation and those who see it as a prime political target.Bannon is demanding that GOP leaders move swiftly to end congressional probes into Russian interference, undermine Muellers investigation and increase scrutiny on Democratic controversies.The Republicans are like church mice, Bannon said Tuesday.No support of the president.Totally gutless.The Hill needs to step up.Senators from both parties on Oct. 31 commented on the charges against three former Trump campaign officials unveiled the day before in special counsel Robert S.

Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes that Republicans should proceed carefully, and he called Mueller a very ethical person.I dont know how you could improve things by interfering, Grassley said.The process just ought to go.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a trusted Trump ally, has launched an investigation into an Obama-era uranium deal and is preparing to invite witnesses this week to testify about the FBIs handling of Russia investigations.Nunes intends to issue subpoenas if people decline to appear, according to people briefed on his plans.Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser who praised Mueller earlier this year after his appointment as special counsel, said he has slowly soured on the former FBI director and agrees that Congress should put a harsher national spotlight on him.Mueller ought to be held accountable, Gingrich said.He ticked through a series of what he considers questionable moves by Mueller and his team, including their handling of former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, whom the government described in an indictment unsealed Monday as a proactive cooperator.Congress should look seriously at whether Mueller put a wire on this guy and sent him around to entrap people, Gingrich said.If that happened, Congress better see the full transcripts, not just the FBIs edited versions.Congress should also ask why theyre raiding [former campaign chairman Paul] Manaforts home at 5 a.m. for a white-collar crime from a few years ago.This sentiment is not heard at the White House, however, where officials have been careful not to antagonize the special counsel.Our approach has been to be cooperative and responsive and to see this come to a quick conclusion, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Have we been aggressive in our comments and our feelings towards the Clinton campaign and the DNC?Yes.But thats where our aggression is seen and nowhere else.Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing Russia matters, said after Mondays indictments of Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, Nothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special counsel, with whom we continue to cooperate.Cobb added, There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating Mueller.Republicans in Congress said Trump is wise to avoid messing with Mueller.There would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).Regardless of which side of the aisle.Thats just beyond the pale.[Upstairs at home, with the TV on, Trump fumes over Russia indictments] Among Republicans, there is broad agreement to bring attention to past controversies involving Hillary Clinton, Trumps Democratic opponent in the 2016 election, that have animated hourly discussions on Fox News Channel and conservative talk radio programs.The White House and allies have waged a public relations battle over the Clinton campaigns and the Democratic National Committees funding of research that resulted in the famous dossier that details Trumps alleged connections to Russia.The dossier has become a lightning rod, with congressional Republican leaders trying to discredit Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier, and the documents author, Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the U.S. intelligence community.Republicans also are trying to bring scrutiny to a 2010 uranium deal approved by the Obama administration, while Clinton was secretary of state.The deal which Trump used as a political cudgel against Clinton during the campaign allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity, although the company cannot export uranium.Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, a Trump confidant, decried the lack of investigative attention on Clinton, a point the president and his top aides have made in recent days.This is not hyperbole, Hannity said Monday night in his on-air monologue, which the president is known to watch regularly.I am not overstating the case.We are at a major crisis point in America tonight.Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today?Some Republican lawmakers have heeded these calls.House and Senate GOP leaders have announced two investigations into the uranium deal, while at least three congressional committees are continuing to look into how the FBI handled Clintons email scandal.But there appears to be little appetite for legislation that would cut Muellers funding or otherwise limit the scope of his investigation, something various Trump allies have suggested is necessary.My basic philosophy is, once you have an independent counsel, you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts, said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding.If somebodys doing a job, you dont want to cut it off.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said: The idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained, or be otherwise restricted, is really out there.I think thats extremely unlikely.Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

Theresa May accused of failing to act over historical Westminster sex claims:::::A Labour MP has accused Theresa May of failing to act over warnings about historical claims of a Westminster sex scandal cover-up.Lisa Nandy claimed she told the then-Home Secretary years ago about allegations Tory whips had "used information about sexual abuse to demand loyalty from MPs".Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Nandy said: "I brought that information to her in this House and I warned her at the time that unless real action was taken we risked repeating those injustices again today."On three occasions I asked her to act and on three occasions she did not."So can I ask her - in this of all weeks, for the fourth time, will she finally take concrete action to tackle this?"Image: Theresa May was accused of ignoring previous warnings Ms Nandy also tweeted a question she asked Mrs May in July 2014, about the child sex abuse insuiry.In it, she highlighted the claim by an ex-Tory whip made in a 1995 documentary that his office routinely helped MPs with scandals, including those "involving small boys", during the 1970s.Mrs May responded on Wednesday by promising to "look back" at the interventions.3 yrs ago, I asked Theresa May to act on evidence that Whips had covered up sexual misconduct.Today at #PMQs I asked her again to act.pic.twitter.com/NBl0iwyJK3 Lisa Nandy (@lisanandy) November 1, 2017 She said: "I will say to her that I am very clear that the whips office - I hope this goes for all whips offices across this House - should make clear to people that where there are any sexual abuse allegations that could be of a criminal nature that people should go to the police."It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips offices - those should go to the police."That continues to be the case."Her response to the 2014 question was a hope that political parties should not be "outside the scope" of the inquiry, now led by Professor Alexis Jay.It comes as a series of fresh sex assault and harassment claims brew in Westminster.A whistle-blower helpline will be "strengthened" and told to recommend all serious allegations to police as a result, the Government announced on Monday.
Investigation into Leave funder Arron Banks over Brexit campaign:::::An investigation has been launched into whether major Leave funder Arron Banks breached rules during the EU referendum campaign.The Electoral Commission announced it is looking at whether or not multi-millionaire Mr Banks committed offences in relation to donations or loans made to campaigners before the Brexit vote.Their investigation will also probe the activities of a firm called Better for the Country Limited (BFTCL), of which Mr Banks is a director, as well as the recipients of funds from both BFTCL and Mr Banks.Mr Banks registered as a permitted participant with the Electoral Commission and gave three loans totalling 6m to the Leave.EU campaign group he jointly founded during the referendum campaign.It made Mr Banks, who has also bankrolled UKIP, the biggest funder to the Brexit campaign.BFTCL was not registered as a permitted participant in the EU referendum, with five registered campaigners reporting donations totalling nearly 2.4m from the company, according to the Electoral Commission.Their investigation will look at whether or not BFTCL was the true source of donations made to campaigners or if it was acting as an agent; and whether or not Mr Banks was the true source of loans reported by a referendum campaigner in his name.Image: The multi-millionaire loaned Leave.EU a total of 6m Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission's director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel, said: "Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread."Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters' confidence."It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place."The Electoral Commission is already conducting a separate investigation into Leave.EU's spending return from the EU referendum campaign.In response to the investigation, Mr Banks told Sky News: "This is a politically motivated decision - all of the financing was UK-based and above board.He added: "I have no confidence in the Electoral Commission which is not up to the job."This should be a judge-led inquiry and overseen by Parliament."They would do be better to look at the funding behind the official Vote Leave and Remain campaigns."Mr Banks also posted on Twitter: "Gosh I'm terrified."Last week, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw told Parliament there was "widespread public concern about foreign, particularly Russian, interference in western democracies".He urged the Government and the Electoral Commission to examine reports over "the role of dark money in the EU referendum" and "the real wealth of Arron Banks".Mr Banks told Sky News: "My only involvement with the Russians was a six hour lunch with the Russian ambassador.I had a great time."
Conservative Dominic Rabb denies dossier's injunction claim:::::Justice minister Dominic Raab has revealed he is on a list of allegations against Tory MPs - but denied any claims he tried to cover-up inappropriate behaviour.He condemned any criminal behaviour inflicted on parliamentary staff but said some claims in the dossier were "gossip or unsubstantiated rumour".Mr Rabb revealed the entry next to his own name read: "Injunction for inappropriate behaviour with a woman."In a statement on his website, the Esher and Walton MP wrote: "I have never been served with any injunction for anything.Nor have I ever sought one."Equally, any insinuation that I have engaged in anything resembling sexual harassment, sexually abusive behaviour or lewd remarks with either Parliamentary colleagues or staff (in any job I have done) is false and malicious."Mr Rabb said the only "tenuous link" he could think of was a "vexatious" newspaper story run in 2011, that he says he successfully sued for libel over.He added that the list was encouraging a "media feeding frenzy against MPs".And while recognising there were some "disturbing allegations" that needed to be taken seriously, Mr Rabb said publishing false allegations was a "form of harassment and intimidation".He warned: "Accountability should mean properly investigating any reports of abuse, without irresponsibly smearing those who have done nothing wrong."Foreign office minister Rory Stewart also revealed he appeared on the list, which is being circulated among Tory researchers.He wrote on Twitter: "This story is completely untrue and deeply hurtful."Mr Stewart was responding to a former parliamentary worker, who praised him and said: "Nothing of the kind implied by my name being included on this spreadsheet ever took place."During my time working in Parliament, Rory Stewart was never anything other than completely professional and an excellent employer."More follows....
Senior Tory suggests Green should stand down amid harassment claims:::::A senior Tory MP has suggested Damian Green should stand down from his Cabinet role while he is investigated over allegations he behaved inappropriately towards a female journalist.Former Conservative minister Anna Soubry told Sky News it is "a matter for him" whether or not the First Secretary of State, who is effectively Theresa May's deputy, continues to serve in Government.But the Broxtowe MP claimed outside of politics, allegations of impropriety resulting in an investigation would lead to an employee's suspension.She said: "It is an allegation that he denies so I think it is very important that we don't have trial by media."In my opinion, it is actually quite a serious allegation and it is a matter for him as to whether or not he continues in his office whilst that investigation is up and running and until findings are made."In other organisations you would be suspended."Now sometimes that's actually quite unjust and people feel greatly aggrieved by that, especially when they are completely exonerated from any allegation."But, I think my point is this, those of us in politics, those of us who also work in Parliament, we should be subjected to exactly the same standards, practices and procedures, disciplinary-type results for all of that, as anybody else in any other organisation or business."Ms Soubry added: "Why should we be different just because we are politicians, or MPs, or members of Government or the Cabinet?"There's a good argument our standards should be higher than what we expect from other people."The Conservative backbencher said she would not tell the Prime Minister what to do in the face of the allegations against Mr Green, but suggested Mrs May "will be robust in this and she must be robust" as a sexual harassment scandal engulfs Westminster.On Tuesday, the most serious claims emerged as a Labour activist revealed she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation by a party official.Ms Soubry said she couldn't be confident Bex Bailey would have been treated any differently had she been a Conservative aide."I don't think any political party has taken these things in the serious way they should have done," she said.Video: Labour activist told 'not to report' sexual assault Prominent Labour MP Jess Phillips said sexual harassment was "inevitable" in Westminster, telling Sky News: "It's a place where power and control play a huge role and there are hundreds if not thousands of people wanting to make their way in the world."That is potentially a toxic environment."The Birmingham Yardley MP accused the PM of failing to show leadership over the scandal, as she questioned why Tory MP Stephen Crabb had not had action taken against him after he apologised for sending explicit messages to a 19-year-old woman.Mrs Phillips also claimed those who have branded the scandal as "hysteria" or a "witch hunt" are "delegitimising" the voices of women.The Prime Minister has referred allegations against Mr Green to the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to "establish the facts".The accusations, made in The Times by freelance columnist Kate Maltby, have been strongly denied by Mr Green who has instructed libel lawyers over the allegations.He said: "It is absolutely and completely untrue that I've ever made any sexual advances on Ms Maltby."Separately, International Trade minister Mark Garnier is being investigated over a possible breach of ministerial rules after he admitted asking a former aide to buy sex toys.
Westminster in Northern Ireland budget push as talks stall:::::The UK Government is preparing to impose a budget on Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire has announced.The Northern Ireland Secretary insisted the move stopped short of a return to "direct rule", and that it would be abandoned if the DUP and Sinn Fein could agree a deal before the deadline.He added it would head off Stormont running out of money by the end of November.Mr Brokenshire said: "No government could simply stand by and allow that to happen."I am, therefore, now taking forward the necessary steps that would enable a Budget Bill to be introduced at Westminster at the appropriate moment in order to protect the delivery of public services in Northern Ireland."Mr Brokenshire also revealed he was taking legal advice on whether MLA - members of the Assembly - should keep being paid while deadlock remains.But he said any interventions by Westminster should not be seen as a reason by both main parties to abandon negotiations."Let me be clear, this is not a barrier to continued political negotiations and the Government will continue to work with the parties with that intent," he said."And indeed, however unlikely, should an Executive be formed speedily enough and a means could be created to provide an exceptional procedure to enable the budget to be passed by the end of November I would be prepared to withdraw the Budget Bill in order for Assembly to legislate for itself."Northern Ireland is now in a 10-month deadlock that has left the region without a devolved administration.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the move was a return to direct rule and a huge backwards step from the Good Friday Agreement, criticising Sinn Fein's role in the talks."Now their failed negotiation is leading to a Tory/DUP government in London, giving Arlene Foster a blank cheque," he said.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who has has been involved in the discussions, said the British government was reluctantly imposing a budget and had held off doing so for as long as possible."Both governments share the view that it is regrettable and deeply concerning that, eight months after the last Assembly election, a powersharing Executive is not in place to make the necessary decisions, including on budgetary issues, for Northern Ireland," he said.Mr Coveney added: "The Irish government, working with the British government, has spared no effort in supporting and facilitating these talks over many months but the issue at the heart of this is the relationship between the parties."The issues under discussion - particularly those on language and culture - go to the heart of the divisions in society here in Northern Ireland and so agreement on them was always going to be very challenging."However, I have always believed that it is possible to reach an honourable compromise which reflects the core principles of the Agreement - partnership, equality and mutual respect."
Labour investigate activist Bex Bailey's rape allegation:::::Labour have launched an investigation after an activist claimed she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation by a party official.Bex Bailey, 25, who previously served on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, has revealed she was raped at the age of 19 by someone senior to her in the party who was not an MP.She told the BBC when she later recounted the incident to a member of Labour staff, she was warned making the claim might "damage" her.Ms Bailey has said she is speaking out in a bid to achieve "actual change" in the way such cases are handled, amid a sexual harassment scandal engulfing Westminster.Labour have responded by launching an investigation, to be headed by an independent legal expert, into her claims.Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Speaking out about rape and sexual harassment takes enormous courage."Bex Bailey has shown incredible bravery by talking publicly about what has happened to her and has my full support and solidarity."I have asked Labour's general secretary, Iain McNicol, to launch an independent investigation into the allegations that she wasn't given the support from the party she should have received and had the right to expect."There will be no tolerance in the Labour Party for sexism, harassment or abuse."Whatever it takes, we are absolutely committed to rooting it out."A Labour spokesperson added the party is taking the allegations "extremely seriously" and are encouraging police to investigate the claims of criminality.Image: Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was 'shocked' by the allegations Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader at the time of Ms Bailey's alleged rape in 2011, said he was "shocked" by the "horrific allegations".He wrote on Twitter: "She is showing great bravery and courage in speaking out."Victims must be supported when they come forward.These allegations must be properly investigated by the police and the Labour Party."Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, expressed her hope new structures put in place by the party this year would prevent anyone else going through Ms Bailey's experience."The Labour Party is extremely serious about tackling any form of abuse and making sure we have a transparent structure in place," she said - praising Ms Bailey as "a strong and amazing young lady".Video: Labour launches independent inquiry over assault claims A host of Labour MPs also praised Ms Bailey's courage, including Liz Kendall, who previously employed Ms Bailey as her top aide.Former shadow minister Mary Creagh told Sky News: "These are horrific allegations about what happened to Bex and my heart goes out to her."Not just the fact this happened but also when she did find the courage to speak out and report it that she was effectively told to hush things up."Ms Creagh suggested political parties had not been taking sexual harassment issues seriously until now."For Bex to come forward in this way is basically an incredible act of courage to speak out and encourage other women, who may have suffered in a similar way, to come forward in the knowledge they will be believed," she added.2/2 Victims must be supported when they come forward.These allegations must be properly investigated by the police and the Labour Party.Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) October 31, 2017 Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Ms Bailey described how she did not contact police immediately after the incident, which happened at a Labour Party event, because she "tried to pretend it hadn't happened".She explained: "It took me a while to sum up the courage to tell anyone in the party."But when I did, I told a senior member of staff, who told me... or it was suggested to me that I not report it."I was told that if I did it might damage me - and that might be their genuine view, it might be that that was the case in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue anyway."Ms Bailey added she did not think she was "even given a cup of tea at the time".She is calling for an independent agency, such as a charity, to deal with allegations made within Parliament or political parties.On Monday, Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom called for an independent support team to be established in Parliament to deal with allegations of abuse, harassment or inappropriate behaviour.Scrutiny has also been cast on MPs' role as employers of their staff and grievance procedures for aides to report concerns at Westminster.
Theresa May 'confident' in ministers amid sexual harassment claims:::::Downing Street says Theresa May "has confidence in her Government and her ministers in getting on with the job", amid claims of inappropriate behaviour at Westminster.But her spokesman refused to say whether the Prime Minister had "full confidence" in Sir Michael Fallon after he apologised for touching a female journalist's knee.The Defence Secretary will not be investigated by the Cabinet Office over the incident however, as no complaint has been made, according to Number 10.When asked if Sir Michael had offered to resign, the spokesman said they did not want to get into "running commentary, speculation".It comes as allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against several MPs and ministers sweep Westminster.International trade minister Mark Garnier is already being investigated by the Cabinet Office over whether he breached the ministerial code when he asked his secretary to buy sex toys.: May reveals thousands of new Brexit jobs Image: Michael Fallon put his hand on journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee The PM's spokesman would not confirm whether any other ministers had been referred to the Cabinet Office.There are also questions as to what would happen if a backbench MP was accused of sexual harassment and cannot, therefore, be judged against the ministerial code.The Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow wrote to all MP staff members on Tuesday encouraging anybody who experiences or witnesses bullying or harassment "of any kind" to report it.He also admitted that "current processes for dealing with this require review" and said that the Commission was working on new ways to "enable people to speak up without fear or favour".A spreadsheet of the alleged inappropriate sexual activities of 40 MPs, including several Cabinet ministers, is currently being circulated by Conservative aides.The list, seen by Sky News, includes claims that some parliamentarians are "handsy with women" and "inappropriate with female and male staff".The Prime Minister has condemned all allegations of sexual impropriety in Westminster as "completely unacceptable".A whistle-blower helpline will be "strengthened" and told to recommend all serious allegations to police as a result of the accusations, the Government announced on Monday.
David Davis suggests Brexit withdrawal deal will 'favour' EU:::::David Davis has suggested Britain's EU divorce deal will "favour" remaining member states as he signalled ministers are ready to accept demands to enshrine the Brexit agreement in law.Revealing the sixth round of formal negotiations will begin next week, the Brexit Secretary said the Government viewed Britain's withdrawal agreement and a deal on the future UK-EU relationship as "inseparable".But, speaking to the House of Lords EU Committee, Mr Davis hinted Britain might have to pay a price in the divorce agreement as he looks to strike a long-term trade deal."In the infamous words or the famous words of the EU, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed," he told peers."And we see these as being linked to each other."The withdrawal agreement, on balance, will probably favour the EU in terms of things like money and so on."Whereas the future relationship will favour both sides and will be important to both of us."Mr Davis rowed back on his previous claim a Brexit deal might not be agreed until the very last moment of the Article 50 period at the end of March 2019.He said he was hopeful a "political agreement" will be reached on the future relationship in October or November next year.This would allow time for both MPs and European capitals to ratify the agreement, the Cabinet minister added, as he hinted at a Government acceptance of demands by pro-Remain Tories for the Brexit deal to be authorised by an Act of Parliament.Senior Conservatives have tabled some of the near 400 amendments to the Government's EU Withdrawal Bill, including one which would ensure MPs and peers the right to approve the terms of Britain's withdrawal.Image: David Davis hinted the Government are ready to accept changes to the EU Withdrawal Bill Commenting on the legislation's ongoing passage through Parliament, Mr Davis said: "We are going to listen carefully to the debate and take on board what people say."He insisted the EU Withdrawal Bill is "much more complex" than the previous Article 50 Bill, which the Government successfully passed unamended, adding: "It's not designed to be untouchable."Mr Davis also used the committee appearance to express confidence Britain would get a "basic deal" on Brexit whatever happens during negotiations, suggesting agreement would be struck on issues such as security cooperation at the very least.He revealed remaining differences on the issue of citizens' rights were likely to be at the forefront of next week's talks.Mr Davis described how the EU were yet to be convinced by Britain's efforts to provide assurance over the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens living in the UK, without the involvement of the European Court of Justice.He said: "The issue from the EU is how trustworthy is this?"Might some future Parliament under, I don't know, Prime Minister Nigel Farage - perhaps I shouldn't be rude - but under some other government alter these rights."We don't believe any government in this country would be likely to do that."In an attempt to break a deadlock in divorce talks, Mr Davis has now proposed writing the final Brexit agreement on EU citizens rights into British law.
Labour bid to force vote on revealing Government's Brexit papers:::::Labour is attempting to force a House of Commons vote ordering the Government to publish 58 studies into the economic impact of Brexit.The party is staging an Opposition Day debate on Wednesday calling on ministers to hand over the information to stop what it calls "a blank cheque for a Tory Brexit".However, there is no guarantee Labour will be successful in forcing a vote.In recent weeks the Government has ordered Tory MPs not to vote against Labour motions.In a bid to thwart that tactic, Labour says its motion will use a procedure that gives the Commons the power to require ministers to release Government papers to Parliament.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer claims that unlike typical Opposition Day debates, the Labour motion - if passed - will be binding on the Government."This debate is about transparency and accountability," said Sir Keir."Ministers cannot keep withholding vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy."Labour recognises the importance of protecting the Government's negotiating position with the EU."However, that does not give ministers the right to impose a blanket ban on publishing any information whatsoever about the economic impact of Brexit."At the start of the negotiations, Theresa May said everyone needed certainty during the Brexit process and that the vote to leave was a vote for Parliament to take back control."If those words meant anything at all, then she should stop sidelining Parliament and give MPs the information they need to properly hold the Government to account."Image: David Davis believes releasing the studies could undermine negotiations Giving evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis repeated the Government's position that it would not publish the papers, which he said was backed by MPs in a Commons vote last year.He told peers: "There was a House of Commons vote in December of last year where we said that we are not required to release anything which undermines the negotiation or the national interest frankly, or the negotiating stance of the British Government."That is the reasoning behind it."The impact assessments produced by the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) cover industrial sectors ranging from advertising, aerospace and agriculture to telecommunications, textiles and tourism.But Mr Davis said their importance should not be exaggerated."I don't think you should overestimate what's in them," he told peers."They're not economic models of each sector, they are looking at how much of it depends on EU markets versus other markets, what other opportunities may be, what the regulatory structures are, all those sorts of things that inform the negotiation, but they are not predictions."Labour is demanding the papers be released to the House of Commons' Brexit Committee, which would then have the right to review the materials and determine what information is put in the public domain.Sir Keir says that if the Government opposes the Labour motion it is saying the committee, which has a Conservative majority, cannot be trusted with the impact assessments.Video: More than 1bn needed for Dover after Brexit Backing Labour's demands, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "The Government must come clean on the impact Brexit will have on people's jobs and livelihoods."It's a poor excuse to say the secrecy is needed for negotiations."The EU 27 will have the same information already from work by their own officials.The only people being kept in the dark are the British public."The longer that ministers hide the truth, the more people will believe it's to bury bad news."A letter signed by 120 MPs, including the Tories' former attorney general Dominic Grieve, previously called on Mr Davis to publish the studies.The Government has also been threatened with legal action over its refusal to release the papers.
Refugee: Yarl's Wood detention centre was like room where I was raped:::::Women who have survived rape and sexual violence are still being sent to immigration detention centres despite recent guidelines advising against it.The charity Women for Refugee Women interviewed 26 women who had spent time in detention.They found 22 were victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and most had been detained for at least a month.Last year the Government introduced new guidance to cut the number of vulnerable people being sent to detention centres.The 'Adults at Risk' policy states individuals at risk should not be detained, including those who have been "a victim of sexual or gender based violence, including female genital mutilation".Image: Yarl's Wood Immigration Centre One of the women in detention was Vivian, who escaped to the UK from West Africa, after her husband forced her into prostitution.She believed a new life in Britain would be better, but instead spent six months this year in the notorious Yarl's Wood detention centre, even though immigration officials agreed she was "at risk".She told Sky News her story: I was homeless from the age of 10.I was driven out of my house because they said I was a witch.Then I met a guy and I told him everything, that I didn't have any family - I trusted him and married him.It turned out to be my worst dream.He started abusing me and using me for prostitution.I'd just go to work and come back and he would lock me in a room and then he would force men to have sex with me.And it was like that until I met somebody that encouraged me to go to the police.I didn't want to go because I know the police are corrupt.And when I came back that was just the beginning of another trend of torture.They beat me so much that they thought I had died or was about to die.Later, a customer saw me and noticed that I was depressed.She encouraged me to relocate to another country and I came to the UK.But when I was in Yarl's Wood detention centre, it was just like I was in that room where men came in and forced me to have sex.It's a confined space and I was afraid of being in a confined space.I was suicidal, I was depressed and it was very traumatic.I wasn't sleeping - I was having flashbacks because of the memories that happened to me in that room.I felt like I was caged in again.I only went to the room when I knew it was absolutely necessary because it reminded me of what happened to me back home.My roommate was always screaming at night as it was bringing her back to what happened to her in her country.They placed me on a watchlist and came to see me every 24 hours because the lady knew that I was suicidal after what happened to me.Still, they said that they would not release me.It was a very bad experience, very traumatic and very depressing.

Mark Warner (D-Va.) listen during a hearing on June 21 on Capitol Hill.| Alex Wong/Getty Images Burr downplays Russian Facebook ad targeting of Michigan, Wisconsin Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (D-N.C.) on Wednesday sought to downplay reports that Russian-linked actors targeted Facebook ads at two key battleground states in the 2016 election.Quoting from a news story that Russian-linked Facebook ads were aimed at Michigan and Wisconsin, with some of the ads targeting specific demographic groups, Burr said the situation wasn't that simple.Story Continued Below "The narrative here is that ads linked to Russia were targeted at pivotal states and directly influenced the election's outcome," he said at the start of a hearing on Russian use of social media to interfere with the election."What you haven't heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at the state of Maryland than of Wisconsin."Burr noted that Maryland voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, and added that Washington D.C. was also targeted by a higher number of ads than Pennsylvania.He emphasized that today's hearing and his panel's investigation were not intended to "relitigate" the outcome of the election.Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.But Burr later emphasized the continuing threat of Russian meddling."We can't afford to kid ourselves about what happened last year and continues to happen today," he said."This is about national security ... deliberate and multifaceted manipulation of the American people by agents of a hostile foreign power."Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), ranking member of the Intelligence committee, echoed concerns about the ongoing nature of the Russian threat.Russians are using social media to set us against ourselves and to undermine our democracy, he said.They did it during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.They are still doing now.Warner called on Facebook, Google and Twitter to "commit more resources" to identify those who exploit their networks for nefarious purposes."You have transformed the way we do everything from shopping for groceries to growing our small businesses," Warner said in his opening statement."But Russias actions are further exposing the dark underbelly of the ecosystem you have created."Warner also criticized the companies for not going far enough in their disclosures to congressional investigators about the extent of Russian meddling on their platforms.Facebook initially told committee representatives last month that it found 3,000 Facebook ads purchased by the Russia-backed Internet Research Agency.Then Monday, the company revealed the existence of some 80,000 unpaid posts and other "organic content."Those posts were seen by 10 times as many people.Warner told Twitter that the company "seems to be vastly under-estimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation."He asserted that Twitter has only uncovered a small percentage of activity from fake accounts.
Grassley pushing for mandatory harassment training:::::Sen. Chuck Grassley proposed that the panel circulate a letter announcing a new policy that Senate employees be required to attend sexual harassment training.| Drew Angerer/Getty Images Grassley pushing for mandatory harassment training 'Sexual harassment training is vitally important to maintaining a respectful and productive work environment in Congress.'Sen. Chuck Grassley, chief author of the law that established a system for handling workplace misconduct on Capitol Hill, is urging that sexual harassment training be made mandatory, not voluntary, for all upper-chamber employees.In a Tuesday letter to the Senate Rules Committee, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, Grassley, an Iowa Republican, proposed that the panel circulate a letter announcing a new policy that Senate employees be required to attend sexual harassment training a step that's currently voluntary.Grassley's request comes after a POLITICO report outlined congressional staffers' sparse awareness of the Office of Compliance, the harassment-handling entity created in 1995 by the Grassley-backed Congressional Accountability Act.Story Continued Below "I am convinced that sexual harassment training is vitally important to maintaining a respectful and productive work environment in Congress," Grassley wrote.The Iowan, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that "my understanding is that many offices require their staff to participate in sexual harassment training" offered by the OOC."But as this training is not mandatory, some may not be receiving it," Grassley added.In the House, the Administration Committee that processes internal chamber rules began a review of current harassment policy on Monday with the approval of the office of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has introduced legislation that would streamline the lengthy process a harassment victim must go through on Capitol Hill to get a complaint acted on, while making harassment training mandatory for lawmakers and their staffers.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.When it comes to the Senate's internal policy, Grassley proposed that a letter from the Rules Committee could suffice to promptly make sexual harassment training mandatory for current and new employees.As precedent, he cited a letter from the rules panel issued in July 2016 that required cybersecurity training for all employees "in an effort to protect the Senate's hardware, network, and data."Beyond Grassley's letter, the OOC is also taking steps to raise its profile among congressional employees who have previously been unaware of its training.In an email circulated among Senate offices on Monday and viewed by POLITICO, the OOC encourages staffers to complete its sexual misconduct awareness program."Sexual harassment scandals in the news have provided a watershed moment for employees to prioritize taking the Office of Compliances sexual harassment training," OOC publications and outreach manager Laura Cech wrote in the email."The online training takes less than 30 minutes, but provides valuable information on what behavior is considered sexual harassment and how to prevent sexual harassment in the congressional workplace."Genevieve Glatsky contributed to this report.
Dems weigh government shutdown over Dreamers fight:::::Sens.Dick Durbin and Kamala Harris (right) listen as a Dreamer speaks during an October news conference.Harris raised the specter of a year-end showdown by declaring she wouldnt vote for a spending bill that doesnt help Dreamers.Other Democrats agree.| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Dems weigh government shutdown over Dreamers fight Senate Democrats are debating whether to embrace brinkmanship in order to win relief for undocumented immigrants.Senate Democrats are weighing whether to use their ultimate leverage the threat of a government shutdown in December in their bid to protect hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers from possible deportation.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a prospective 2020 presidential hopeful, raised the specter of a year-end showdown last week when she declared she wouldnt vote for a spending bill that doesnt help children of undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors.Republicans will need Democratic votes definitely in the Senate and almost certainly in the House, too to pass legislation to keep the government funded.Story Continued Below Other Democrats told Politico they agreed with Harris.Itd be very difficult for me to support the end-of-the-year bill, whatever that may be, if DACA has not been taken care of, said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).If we cant take care of the Dreamers, I think it jeopardizes Americas standing on our principle strength: our values.But a number of other Democratic senators said they arent willing to go there at least not yet.It is a topic which we are not raising at this point, because we hope we dont even need to think about it, said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a party leader on immigration.But I tell you, everyone Ive spoken to starting with me are very serious this has to be done this year.With influential GOP senators trying to craft an immigration plan that can get buy-in from both parties, many Senate Democrats want to leave space for the talks to unfold without resorting to hard-line tactics.But less than six weeks remain until government funding runs out Dec. 8, and its unclear how lawmakers will bridge the immigration rift by the end of the year, as top Democrats have promised.Morning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Meanwhile, liberal Democrats in the House are vowing more vocally to withhold their votes for a must-pass spending package if lawmakers dont come up with a congressional backstop for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Donald Trump plans to phase out starting in March.For now, most Senate Democrats are signaling caution, concerned that an uncompromising public stance could upend prospects of a bipartisan deal and reluctant to be seen as using Dreamers as bargaining chips.Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are trying to round up support for their legislation that would let nearly 700,000 current DACA recipients and other young undocumented immigrants obtain legal status.Graham has been working on a parallel track with other Republicans to find border security and other restrictive immigration measures that lawmakers could then pair with legislation that would shield Dreamers.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) declined to say whether she would vote against a spending measure without a DACA fix, stressing: I feel very strongly we need to get it done and we need to get it done now.If we do nothing between now and the end of the year and try and jam it into the spending bill, it makes it less likely that it will be a bipartisan, lasting solution to the challenge of the Dreamers, said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).But you should hear clearly the determination of many of us to get this fixed.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, made similar comments: There are a number of Republicans whove been out there, this is something we need to fix.I think we need to give that a chance to work and we should all try and act in good faith on that.Other contentious provisions are also in play during the year-end fight over annual funding levels and policy prescriptions.After backing off his insistence to secure funding for a border wall in September, Trump could again push to fund it a nonstarter among Democrats and even some Republicans.Congress could also use the spending package to continue payments to insurers for key Obamacare subsidies that Trump is scrapping, adding a contentious health care debate to the scramble on Capitol Hill.And lawmakers have yet to resolve the most basic element of a funding package: what the spending levels for federal agencies should be.Democratic leaders promised earlier this year to try to attach a DACA fix to other bills, such as legislation reauthorizing a childrens health care program.But that program hasnt been extended and few must-pass measures have actually been sent to the White House since Trumps DACA announcement.Some immigration advocates are urging lawmakers to include the Dream Act in a spending package, betting that GOP leaders cant move a stand-alone measure because immigration is such a divisive issue for the party.Were confident that, if Congress doesnt address this crisis before December, which would be preferable, Democrats will make it clear that the Dream Act has to be included, said Frank Sharry, executive director of the advocacy group Americas Voice.But congressional Republicans are focused on tax reform rather than immigration.And senior GOP lawmakers say they want to keep immigration separate from the year-end spending talks.I dont believe it will, nor should it, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said on whether a DACA fix will be included in a December spending deal.If you start cramming a bunch of other stuff into it, its gonna be harder to get the votes to pass it.Senate Democrats may well decide to embrace brinkmanship closer to December, particularly if progress lags on a DACA deal in Congress.But for now, most are keeping their powder dry.DACA is a really urgent priority for me, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).I cant say whether I would vote against a spending bill at this point, but I will do almost anything possible to assure that we approve of a DACA bill.
Roy Moore, Senate Republicans try to make nice:::::Roy Moore, who dropped by the Senate Republicans weekly policy lunch on Tuesday, declined to directly answer repeated questions about whether he still believes Mitch McConnell should no longer be the Senate majority leader.Roy Moore, Senate Republicans try to make nice The GOP is largely rallying around the Alabama firebrand, and hes returning the favor.Roy Moore has made his antipathy for Mitch McConnell the centerpiece of his Senate bid but now that hes poised to become the next senator from Alabama, Moore is making nice with the GOP establishment.The most notable shift: Moore, who dropped by the Senate Republicans weekly policy lunch on Tuesday, declined to directly answer repeated questions about whether he still believes McConnell should no longer be the Senate majority leader, as he has declared numerous times during his campaign.Story Continued Below Im not going to give an opinion on that right now, Moore finally said in response to reporters' questions.The controversial former Alabama Supreme Court justice noted that he didnt discuss that issue with McConnell when the two men briefly chatted Tuesday, and that the discussion was very nice.Nor was Moore willing to discuss his divisive past remarks, such as his view that homosexuality should be illegal or that Congress should prohibit Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who is Muslim, from taking the congressional oath because of his faith.Ill address that with people Im talking to, Moore said on Tuesday as he left the Republican lunch.Im not answering any questions on issues right now.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Few Senate Republicans have condemned those comments from Moore, instead carefully distancing themselves from the former judges more inflammatory remarks but making clear they still plan to back him as the GOP nominee.Their support of Moore is particularly awkward this week as Senate Republicans lambaste Democrats for challenging Amy Coney Barrett, an appellate court nominee, for her Catholic faith.Senate Republicans have tried to project a show of unity in the Alabama Senate race after a bitterly divisive primary.Party heavyweights such as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas have endorsed Moore, and the Senate Leadership Fund, a McConnell-aligned super PAC that battered Moore in the primary, released a memo Tuesday showing Moore with a 17-point advantage over Democrat Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 special election.I dont agree with anybody 100 percent of the time, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said after the lunch.Im just responsible for my own words and actions.Ill let the voters of Alabama decide who they want to represent them.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he has trouble with Moores comments, but added: If he gets duly elected, Im going to support him.Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who introduced Moore to fellow Senate Republicans at the lunch, said simply: I havent heard his comments.Inside the GOP lunch on Tuesday, Moore did not say much except introducing himself and commenting that his race is going well, senators said.Other Republicans did not challenge Moore directly on his past remarks during the lunch, and the candidate shook hands with a handful of his potential future colleagues.Moores visit comes nearly a month after a similar visit to Washington during which the Alabama Senate candidate met privately with conservative senators while rebuffing senior Senate Republicans and forgoing the customary visit to the conference-wide lunch.But now, Moores campaign is preparing to raise cash in conjunction with the national party apparatus, and he is reaching out to senior GOP senators such as South Dakota Sen. John Thune, who said Tuesday that he disagrees with Moores comments that Ellison should not be able to serve because of his faith.I dont know him, Thune said.I saw him, I didnt get a chance to visit with him.But Id like to get a chance to chat with him a little bit, just kind of get acquainted and sort of find out what his views are.Look, this is a candidate, he can say whatever he wants, added Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).I dont subscribe to those beliefs, obviously, and well see how the people of Alabama react to that.Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, the rare Republican who has forcefully condemned Moores views, spoke out again Tuesday as the chamber prepared to confirm Barrett to the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.Criticizing Democrats for their questioning that, Flake argued, bordered on ridicule, the retiring senator drew a parallel not only to Moores candidacy but President Donald Trumps campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the United States.When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim shouldnt be a member of Congress because of his religious faith, it was wrong, Flake said.That this same judge is now my partys nominee [for] the Senate from Alabama should concern us all.Other Republicans, however, didnt show much concern.Roy Moore is unique.Ive said that before.But hes well educated, West Point graduate, lawyer, captain in the Army, you know?Hes been around, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said.People have to answer for their own stuff, but hes the Republican nominee and I support him in the general election.
House GOP struggles to unite on tax bill:::::House GOP struggles to unite on tax bill Republicans were forced to delay the release of their plan, as key details have yet to be finalized.House Republicans postponed the much-anticipated rollout of their tax reform proposal Tuesday night, an ominous sign for a direly needed legislative accomplishment for President Donald Trump and his party.House Ways and Means Committee members spent all day Tuesday holed up in conference rooms trying to iron out last-minute disagreements.Senior committee staff worked through the night Monday and were expected to do the same on Tuesday to unveil the bill at a GOP Conference meeting at 9 a.m. Wednesday.Story Continued Below But in a move that foreshadows the difficulties awaiting the party of Reagan, GOP leaders and tax writers postponed their big reveal to buy themselves more time.They now hope to release the bill Thursday but privately acknowledge they have a number of disagreements to resolve first.The delay comes despite the half-decade Republicans have spent readying themselves for this very moment.The Ways and Means Committee for years has held tax hearings and working groups, but overhauling the code means creating winners and losers in a politically sensitive environment.The stakes couldn't be higher.After failing to repeal Obamacare, tax reform could mean the difference between a Republican majority and a Democratic takeover in 2018.But for the bill to pass, Republicans known for their constant infighting will have to unify.Thats proving easier said than done.Rumors of a potential postponement started to spread Tuesday afternoon.At the center of the problem were questions about how to pay for the proposed $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, since any major revenue-generator is certain to antagonize some powerful lobby or group of lawmakers who could defeat it.Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Our plan is to release the bill tomorrow, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters Tuesday afternoon, leaving himself some wiggle room for a delay.Asked whether the expected Wednesday release would be legislative text, Brady responded: When we release the bill, it will be text.Later, Brady issued a statement formally announcing the delay, adding, We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week.Some details of the bill started leaking out Tuesday after Speaker Paul Ryan briefed conservative leaders on text that had been finalized.The proposal, sources in the meeting said, would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, meeting their initial goal.Theyve also decided to keep the current top 39.6 percent tax rate on the wealthiest individuals though they have not settled on which incomes would be hit by that rate.Ryan told conservative group leaders Thursday that the income threshold for the top rate would likely be higher than it currently is, likely between $750,000 and $1 million.He said the estate tax would likewise be repealed but may have to be phased out to save money in the short term.But it's the unresolved issues that caused Ways and Means members the most heartburn this week and ultimately led to the delay.Those include: how to win over GOP lawmakers from high-tax states that are balking over curbing the state and local tax deduction, which their constituents rely on.There are also question about how to ensure that wealthy individuals dont take advantage of the lower 25 percent small business or pass-through rate.Many of the unresolved items are hot-button issues, including what to do with 401(k) retirement plans.Trump asked Brady in a phone conversation last week to drop his plans to curb such tax preferred savings.And some senior House Republicans who believe that doing so would incite severe pushback have been urging Brady to leave the matter alone.But Brady has refused to ditch the idea of imposing some limitation on the popular retirement plans.The reason comes down to basic math: Republicans want to lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, and collapse and lower individual rates into four brackets and targeting 401(k) plans could help pay for those cuts.The search for cash is one reason the panel earlier this week briefly considered the idea of phasing in the lower corporate tax rate over several years instead of immediately all at once an idea Senate tax writers has discussed.But the White House and more than a few GOP tax committee members quickly nixed that proposal, and it is not expected to be included in the legislation.We're not looking for that, no, Trump told reporters when asked Tuesday whether he was open to such a phase-in.We're not looking for that.Hopefully not.Ways and Means members have been trying to tweak other provisions in search of savings.Sources say the panel has been sending proposals to the Joint Committee on Taxation several times a day to see how much money they would save, and then shopped the ideas to panel members.I would say there is a lot of Red Bull and Monster being drank in there right now, said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the House Republican Conference.The whole Ways and Means crew knew this would be a tough lift and weve not even gotten to the rollout of the actual details yet!The vast majority of House Republicans have only an inkling of whats in the legislation.The details, including the key question of who loses under the legislation, have been closely held by party leaders for months in order to keep lobbyists at bay.Even tax aides to members of the Ways and Means committee have not yet been briefed on the plan.Ryan "said the committee is turning the dials and getting it to work.Its all last-minute stuff, said Scott Hodge, president of Tax Foundation, as he left Ryans office after meeting with the speaker.I think they have all this its just a matter of tweaking addressing certain members interests and concerns.During a gaggle Tuesday, Brady suggested there were plenty of key decisions that still needed to be made before a measure could be rolled out, and that the GOP Conferences response would likely lead to some changes in the bill before its considered by his committee a mark-up thats supposed to be next week.Without offering details, Brady said the House bill would either strengthen retirement accounts or leave them as is, and noted that he still planned to have further meetings with GOP lawmakers from New York and New Jersey concerned about the state and local tax deduction ahead of the tax overhauls release.We certainly are listening very carefully to make sure that were delivering tax relief for those families, he said.And asked whether final decisions had been made on expanding the child tax credit and where to set individual brackets, Brady would offer only: I think we have a real good feel for all of this.Time is running out to move those dials, however.And Republicans may have to release their tax plan without all the wrinkles ironed out.Some Republicans think thats exactly what will happen with the dispute over the state and local tax deduction.As a middle ground, Brady has floated the idea of allowing people to deduct their property taxes.But leaders are not sure the change would be enough to win over Republicans from New York and California who could block any tax bill that hurts their constituents.By leaving some matters unresolved, GOP leaders risk blowback at a time when theyre in desperate need of momentum.House leaders hope to pass the tax bill by Thanksgiving and send the bill to Trump before the end of the year.They could know as early as Thursday afternoon whether thats an impossible feat.Within just a few hours of unveiling their Obamacare replacement bill last spring, GOP leaders knew they had a serious problem: Conservatives came out swinging against the plan, which they dubbed Obamacare lite.Something similar happened when former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) released his own tax bill in 2014.The Republican Conference turned on him and the bill, scoffing at the pay-fors and leaving the bill dead in the water.GOP leaders and Brady are doing their utmost to safeguard against such a situation this time.Ryan (R-Wis.) huddled with Trump at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before meeting with conservative tax leaders who are expected to help defend the tax plan against attacks from Democrats or K Street.And theyre expected to try to rally the GOP Conference around the bill Thursday morning if theres a bill by then.Even if the already-delayed rollout goes smoothly, the tax bill has a long road ahead.The Senate tax bill, expected to be released next Wednesday, is likely to look different from the Houses.Some of the tough choices that the House made might not fly among Senate Republicans, who have a narrow margin for passage and can lose only two GOP votes.Sen. John Thune, the chambers No.3 Republican, for instance, said the Senate is undecided about what to do with the state and local tax deduction.Were trying to sync this up as much as we can, but we realize theres going to be differences of opinion, said Thune.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) suggested that resolving those issues might drag them well past New Years Eve."I know there's going to be a lot of hype around the fact that if Republicans somehow don't pass tax reform by the end of the year, then X happens, but I'm a lot more focused on the details of the policies that we put in place," he said."If it takes longer to get it done right, that's not an issue to me."Nancy Cook, Josh Dawsey and Colin Wilhelm contributed to this report.

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Trump to meet GOP senators on DACA fix Lawmakers say they will go to the White House on Thursday to discuss progress on helping so-called Dreamers.President Donald Trump has invited several Senate Republicans to the White House on Thursday to hash out details of a potential legislative measure on so-called Dreamers, according to multiple senators who plan to attend.The invitation list for the meeting, confirmed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and others familiar with it, is still fluctuating, but at least a half-dozen senators who have privately been trying to hammer out an immigration plan are expected to attend.Story Continued Below Trump wants to gauge the progress on Capitol Hill thus far of any legislative fix to the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, people familiar with the meeting said.The president announced last month that he would wind down the program starting next March.Senate Republicans also want to pitch various security and enforcement proposals that would be paired with legislation that gives a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and other young undocumented immigrants who came here as minors.Morning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The purpose of the meeting is for us to hear from the president his views of some of the thoughts that we have, Grassley said in an interview Tuesday.I cant say theres much progress being made, because weve got to sit down with the Democrats.Theres no way a partisan bill is going to pass.Senate Republicans have been working quietly to piece together a DACA deal that would not only pick up conservative support but also Democrats, who are urging lawmakers to address the Dreamer issue by the end of the year.
McConnell floats rules change to limit debate on nominations:::::The consideration process for presidential nominees "is a different matter" than the legislative filibuster, Mitch McConnell said, lambasting recent Democratic slowdowns.| Susan Walsh/AP Photo McConnell floats rules change to limit debate on nominations McConnell's protest rings hollow for Democrats who keenly recall his obstruction of former President Barack Obama's nominees.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested on Tuesday that he would support a rules change limiting Democrats' ability to delay confirmation of President Donald Trump's nominees.Although they cannot filibuster Trump's nominees because of previous rules changes, Democrats have tied up the Senate floor with lengthy confirmation debates from Cabinet nominees to a series of less-senior names whose approvals were delayed during the tense battle over Obamacare repeal.Story Continued Below McConnell has committed to maintaining the Senate minority's power to filibuster legislation, but on Tuesday he left the door open to backing further limits on Democratic slowdowns of the confirmation process.The consideration process for presidential nominees "is a different matter" than the legislative filibuster, McConnell said, lambasting recent Democratic slowdowns as "just simply ridiculous."Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.McConnell's protest rings hollow for Democrats who keenly recall his obstruction of former President Barack Obama's nominees, including Judge Merrick Garland's failure to get a hearing after Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court."Sen. McConnell does not come to the court with clean hands on these issues," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters when asked about the Kentucky Republican's suggestion of a future rules change."He delayed and blocked so many of Obama's nominees."Schumer, like many of his fellow Democrats, also noted that Trump already has gotten more judges confirmed to the federal bench than Obama did at the same point in his presidency, despite the GOP's push for a faster pace of confirmations.McConnell cited a proposal crafted by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) that would limit the minority's power to run out the clock after debate has been formally curtailed.Lankford began floating the idea in April as Democrats forced a procedural showdown over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch who occupies the seat Garland had been nominated to fill.The Senate currently has 30 hours of floor time to discuss a nominee after cloture is invoked to limit debate, and Lankford's plan would limit that to 8 hours.McConnell said on Tuesday that "there may be a possibility to adjust" the amount of time Democrats have to prolong floor debate on nominees after cloture is invoked "in a way more consistent with the Senate, and the administration getting its positions filled in a timely fashion."McConnell suggested that Lankford is seeking Democratic buy-in for the rules change, and Lankford said through a spokesman: Conversations with my colleagues about my proposal have been positive.The American people expect us to get more work done."But another member of GOP leadership said that bipartisanship shouldn't be a requirement in order to limit the minority's ability to force lengthy confirmation debates.If Democrats don't scale back their delays, "I think we should do whatever is necessary, either with cooperation or without, to stop that procedure from being used to keep us from the other work we need to do," said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, No.5 in Republican leadership."It's obvious that's what they're doing."
Grassley introduces bill to toughen foreign lobbying oversight after Manafort indictment:::::Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has long raised flags about enforcement of foreign lobbyist registration, and he held a hearing on the subject in July that initially was expected to include testimony from Paul Manafort | Alex Wong/Getty Images Grassley introduces bill to toughen foreign lobbying oversight after Manafort indictment A day after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was indicted on charges that included failing to register as a foreign agent, a top Senate Republican introduced legislation Tuesday intended to stiffen enforcement of federal rules for foreign lobbyists.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.)to propose identical bills they said would address ambiguous requirements for those lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.That ambiguity has, over the years, led to a sharp drop in the number of registrations and the prospect of widespread abuses, they said.Story Continued Below The new bills would empower the Department of Justice to enforce registrations under the Foreign Agents Registration Act by demanding the production of documents and testimony to ensure compliance.They also would eliminate a broad exemption from registration established in 1995 and charge DOJ with developing a comprehensive enforcement strategy, which would be reviewed by the departments inspector general and later by the Government Accountability Office.Grassley has long raised flags about enforcement of foreign lobbyist registration, and he held a hearing on the subject in July that initially was expected to include testimony from Manafort, though in the end he did not appear.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Grassley said Monday, after Manaforts indictment, that he was pleased to see DOJ using its enforcement power.An aide said the release of the bill Tuesday, though, was in the works well before Grassley was aware of the pending charges.Policy makers are here to serve the interests of the American people, so we need to know when someone is pushing the priorities of a foreign interest, Grassley said in a statement.Unfortunately, weve seen time and again how lobbyists of foreign principals skirt existing disclosure laws to conceal their clients identities and agendas.Johnson's spokeswoman Ainsley Holyfield said in a statement that the Manafort news, as well as the resignation of Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta following scrutiny from Mueller, only amplified the need for change."The importance of reforming FARA cannot be overstated.Recent news stories regarding Tony Podesta and Paul Manafort merely highlight a need that has been reported as far back as 1974 and gone uncorrected," Holyfield said.Among the 12 charges that Manafort and longtime deputy Richard Gates were slapped with Monday were accusations of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign principal and making false and misleading FARA statements about their work on behalf of a Kremlin-aligned Ukrainian political leader.CORRECTION: The quote in the eighth paragraph was initially incorrectly attributed to Rep.

Jeb Hensarling announced Tuesday he will not seek reelection in 2018, marking the end of a political career defined by the Texas Republican's long-running struggle to pare back government intervention in the economy.Hensarling, first elected to Congress in 2002, is in his last term as chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, where he has spent years fighting with mixed success to roll back regulations and phase out federal programs.Story Continued Below In a statement, Hensarling said the time seemed right for his departure given the upcoming end of his chairmanship.He plans to serve out the rest of his term."Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned," he said.There was speculation after Donald Trump's election last year that Hensarling would leave Congress, when his name was floated for Treasury secretary.He is close with Vice President Mike Pence, and several of his key aides and allies have joined the Trump administration.Hensarling did not move up the ranks of House leadership when openings arose in the last several years.But he stayed in Congress, and in June he scored his highest-profile victory as chairman when the House passed a bill he sponsored that would enact a sweeping rollback of financial regulations.Yet, like a number of signature proposals that Hensarling has pushed over the years, it is unlikely to become law in its current form because the Senate would be unable to pass it.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time."Some ideas may take years or Congresses to gel," he said in June.Many progressives found those ideas distasteful.For years, advocates for tougher banking regulation have objected to Hensarling's crusade to scale back financial rules, including the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Public Citizen financial policy advocate Bart Naylor said Hensarling "promoted a libertarian fantasy where consumer protection isnt part of his vocabulary."His almost unwavering devotion to limited government has often put him at odds even with other members of the GOP, including his party's own leadership.In recent months, Hensarling has been clashing with fellow Republicans over his plans to overhaul the National Flood Insurance Program, which he has struggled to put his conservative stamp on since early in his chairmanship.He's turning now to what might be the most insurmountable policy challenge under his purview: rejiggering the nation's housing finance system, dominated by the government-backed mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."He always focused on what he thought was the right thing to do whether others found it politically correct or not," former Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas) said.People close to Hensarling said they were not surprised by his announcement."When we started working together in 2001, he expected to be a three- to five-term member, max," former Hensarling chief of staff Dee Buchanan said."He's stayed quite a bit longer, and he never imagined finishing a six-year term as an exclusive committee chairman within that time horizon."His daughter, Claire, was born 10 days before his first primary victory, so I think he's looking forward to being a dad and husband without a 2,600-mile commute for the first time in 16 years."Hensarling's departure is not likely to jeopardize GOP control of his House seat.His 5th District in Texas has leaned heavily Republican Trump carried it with 62 percent of the vote in 2016, while Mitt Romney got 65 percent in 2012.And Democrats did not even field a candidate against Hensarling in either of the past two elections.The window to file for the March primary election opens Nov. 11.Hensarling's announcement will rekindle speculation about who will take his committee's gavel next.The lawmaker long seen as a top contender is Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who serves as the committee's vice chairman and the House GOP's chief deputy whip.McHenry could pursue a higher-ranking House leadership position instead if the opportunity presented itself.Other names that have been in the mix include Reps. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and Pete King (R-N.Y.).Sources following the race also said Reps. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) were worth watching.McHenry remains interested in chairing the committee after Hensarling, according to a source familiar with the lawmaker's thinking.A spokeswoman for Luetkemeyer said he will "continue talking with and seeking advice from House Republican Leadership and his colleagues as he is seriously considering running for the chairmanship.""I think the job is McHenrys to take and view Luetkemeyer as the next likeliest for the gavel if the GOP retains the majority," Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky said.Neugebauer, who served as a senior Financial Services Committee member and key Hensarling ally before his retirement early this year, said he expected his old colleague to "go out swinging."Indeed, Hensarling said that over the next year "much work remains" at the Financial Services Committee in the areas of housing finance reform, regulatory relief, cybersecurity and capital formation."There are 14 months left in my congressional term to continue the fight for individual liberty, free enterprise and limited constitutional government the causes for which I remain passionate," Hensarling said.Scott Bland contributed to this report.
White House 'close' on state, local tax decision, N.Y. rep says:::::White House 'close' on state, local tax decision, N.Y. rep says Top Trump administration officials are nearing a decision on the federal deduction for state and local taxes in a tax overhaul, they told New Yorks nine GOP House members late Monday.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn promised in a phone call with the lawmakers they would work on the issue throughout the day Tuesday, said Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.).Story Continued Below Theyre saying theyre close, Donovan said.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday predicted a compromise to preserve the deduction for state and local property taxes would secure a lot of votes for the overall tax plan from California and New York GOP lawmakers.I think therell be a little something in there to make sure those individuals are all taken care of, McCarthy, who has been critical of the state and local tax deduction, told reporters in a conference call.In the end, if you look at the entire tax bill, theyll actually have a savings.The exact contours of the compromise are still a work in progress.House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, confirmed that it wouldnt include keeping the deduction for state and local income taxes, but he would not say whether the property tax write-off would be capped.To be determined, he said.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a Ways and Means member who joined McCarthy on the call, also demurred when asked about a cap.As to where the final dials are, well know that in 24 hours, Reed said.Let the process take its course and well have an open and honest debate as we go through the committee process to fine-tune this product even further.Donovan wouldn't say whether hed vote against tax legislation if it doesn't treat the longstanding deduction to his liking.Congressional Republican leaders previously proposed getting rid of it, with support from President Donald Trump.More recently, in an effort to maintain support for their broader tax bill, House GOP leadership proposed keeping the deduction for property taxes but ending it for non-federal income and sales taxes.Mnuchin and Cohn didnt commit to fully preserving or eliminating the existing deduction, which matters in high-tax states like New York that funnel more tax revenue into federal coffers than they get back in benefits, Donovan said.They also didnt commit to a compromise, either.But Mnuchin's and Cohns New York ties both have lived and worked there give them a better understanding of the situation than others who have called for killing the deduction, Donovan said.The same is true of Trump, Donovan said.They understand how important it is to the nine of us and the people we represent, he said.All nine Republican House members from New York spoke on the call, Donovan said, adding that he and the others heard more about this issue from constituents than anything else over their past few days back in their districts.

Manafort indicted, surrenders to FBI:::::Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is charged with conspiracy against the United States, tax fraud and money laundering in the first indictment to come from the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller.The 12-count indictment includes five counts against Manaforts former business partner and protg Rick Gates, who was ousted from the pro-Trump group America First Policies in April.Manafort turned himself in at the FBI's Washington, D.C., field office on Monday morning.ADVERTISEMENT The charges are related to work done by Manafort and Gates on behalf of a pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine.Mueller alleges they were paid tens of millions of dollars for the work and then laundered the money in order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities.The sprawling 31-page indictment, unsealed on Monday morning, makes no mention of Manaforts work for President Trumps campaign, which began in March of 2016 and ended with his ouster in August.Separately, however, prosecutors announced that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopolous, 30, had pleaded guilty last month to lying to investigators about conversations he had with a foreign professor who told him he had thousands of emails containing "dirt" on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE.He also allegedly lied about his contact with a Russian woman who the Justice Department says he worked with "in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials."Papadopolous allegedly emailed a Russian with connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding information from the correspondences to a top campaign official not identified in the documents.On numerous occasions, he tried to negotiate a meeting with either Trump or campaign officials and "members of President Putin's office" as well as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, officials said.Those meetings never occurred.It is unclear whether Papadopolous is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation.The announcement of his plea was released an hour or so after new broke about Manafort and Gates.Mueller has the authority not only to investigate any potential collusion between Trumps campaign and Moscow, but also any auxiliary matters arising from the primary probe in this case, Manaforts financial dealings.According to the indictment released Monday, Manafort and Gates, together with others, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of a government agency, namely the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury a common charge in tax cases.The two have been charged with laundering tens of millions of dollars through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts, according to the indictment.More than $75 million flowed through various offshore accounts set up by Manafort and he laundered more than $18 million, prosecutors allege.Gates transferred more than $3 million from offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled, according to the indictment.In addition to the conspiracy and money laundering charges, Manafort and Gates also allegedly ran afoul of laws requiring individuals lobbying on behalf of a foreign principal to register with the U.S. government.The two face charges for acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, misleading the government about the nature of their foreign lobbying efforts and making false statements as well as seven counts of failure to file the appropriate government documents for foreign financial accounts.Beginning in 2006, according to the indictment, Manafort began to do work for the Party of Regions, a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.In 2010, its candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, was elected president.He was later forced to flee to Russia in 2014 in the wake of popular protests, effectively ending Manaforts work.During that period, Manafort and Gates allegedly created more than a dozen foreign financial entities in Cyprus, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Seychelles, according to Muellers indictment.But in his tax filings from 2008 to 2014, Manafort reported that he did not have authority over any foreign bank accounts, according to the indictment.He allegedly used his offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the U.S. on which he took out mortgages, thereby gaining tax-free cash in the United States.Prosecutors allege that Manafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income, spending millions on luxury goods and services through payments wired from his offshore accounts.Questioned about these activities by federal investigators in 2016, Mueller claims, Manafort and Gates responded with a series of false and misleading statements.During the same time period, Manafort and Gates also engaged in a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in the United States at the direction of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions and the government of Ukraine without providing the appropriate disclosures to the federal government, prosecutors allege.They solicited two unnamed Washington, D.C., firms to lobby members of Congress about Ukraine sanctions and the validity of the elections, among other things, providing the firms a false and misleading cover story that would distance themselves and the government of Ukraine from the two companies.Manafort for months has been suspected to be one of the most high-profile targets of Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the election.In July, the FBI conducted a pre-dawn raid of a home that Manafort owns in Alexandria, Va.Some legal experts have suggested that Muellers decision to move forward with an indictment of Manafort is a signal that he is trying to flip him or convince him to act as an informant, potentially about the Trump campaign.This is consistent with an early indictment to get Manafort to flip, tweeted Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor who is running for Illinois attorney general as a Democrat.Indictment makes clear that Mueller is seeking *a ton* of forfeiture--I imagine that gives him some serious leverage over Manafort, tweeted Carissa B Hessick, a criminal law professor at the University of North Carolina.Or, others say, Mueller may also simply believe that he has sufficient evidence against Manafort to prove charges in court or both.The indictment also raised questions about how the president will respond.Trump has repeatedly characterized Muellers investigation as a witch hunt crafted by his political enemies, and speculation has roiled Washington that he could try to either fire Mueller or pardon anyone the special counsel indicts.He drew scrutiny earlier in the year for his controversial pardon of Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio and has reportedly explored with aides the breadth of his authority to immunize individuals from legal peril.This story was updated

Court partially blocks Trump's transgender military ban:::::A federal court has blocked President Trump in part from changing the military's transgender policy as a case against his ban works its way through court.A judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled Monday that Trump's directive changing the transgender policy back to what it was before June 2016 and banning new transgender recruits from enlisting cannot be enforced while the case is being reviewed in court.However, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to block the ban on funds for gender reassignment surgery.In a 76-page memo accompanying the ruling, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their case arguing the transgender ban violates their Fifth Amendment right to due process.ADVERTISEMENT The court finds that a number of factorsincluding the sheer breadth of the exclusion ordered by the directives, the unusual circumstances surrounding the Presidents announcement of them, the fact that the reasons given for them do not appear to be supported by any facts, and the recent rejection of those reasons by the military itself strongly suggest that Plaintiffs Fifth Amendment claim is meritorious, she wrote.The plaintiffs in the case, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), celebrated the injunction Monday as a "complete victory."This is a complete victory for our plaintiffs and all transgender service members, who are now once again able to serve on equal terms and without the threat of being discharged, Shannon Minter, NCLRs legal director, said in a statement.This court saw straight through the smokescreen the government tried to create to hide the bias and prejudice behind Trumps change in military policy," added Jennifer Levi, director of GLADs transgender rights project."This clear, powerful ruling confirms that there is no legitimate reason to exclude transgender people from military service.Despite the judge's denial of the injunction on the ban for surgical funding, Minter and Levi told reporters on a conference call that transgender service members will be able to receive all medically necessary care.They clarified that this is because the end of the ruling says the military's policy will "revert to the status quo" before Trump policy, which includes covering surgery.In July, Trump tweeted that he would ban transgender people from serving in the military in any capacity.He made good on the tweets in August, signing a presidential memo that prohibits the military from enlisting transgender people and from using funds to pay for gender transition-related surgery.The memo also gave Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisPence to visit ICBM base McAfee stops allowing governments to review source code Terror designation for Irans Revolutionary Guards a necessary first step MORE six months to determine what to do with transgender troops who are currently serving.NCLR and GLAD sued in August on behalf of six unnamed service members and two recruits.The government asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that because Mattis is in the midst of the six-month review and has said no service member will be discharged in the interim, the plaintiffs have not been affected by the policy yet.But Kollar-Kotelly ruled that while perhaps compelling in the abstract, the governments arguments for dismissal wither away under scrutiny.The memorandum unequivocally directs the military to prohibit indefinitely the accession of transgender individuals and to authorize their discharge, she wrote.This decision has already been made.These directives must be executed by a date certain, and there is no reason to believe that they will not be executed.Plaintiffs have established that they will be injured by these directives, due both to the inherent inequality they impose, and the risk of discharge and denial of accession that they engender.But the plaintiffs did not establish that they would by harmed by the ban on funds for gender reassignment surgery, Kollar-Kotelly ruled.Therefore, she said, the court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin the aspect of Trumps policy.Still, she wrote, the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their case against the accession and retention policies because the governments arguments for the ban appear to be hypothetical and extremely overbroad.As far as the court is aware at this preliminary stage, all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself, she added, referring to the militarys 2016 study done during the Obama administration that led to allowing open service by transgender troops.Kollar-Kotelly also said the court has to consider the circumstances of Trumps announcement -- that is, the fact that it was made abruptly on Twitter.The President abruptly announced, via Twitterwithout any of the formality or deliberative processes that generally accompany the development and announcement of major policy changes that will gravely affect the lives of many Americansthat all transgender individuals would be precluded from participating in the military in any capacity, she wrote.These circumstances provide additional support for plaintiffs claim that the decision to exclude transgender individuals was not driven by genuine concerns regarding military efficacy.Asked during a press briefing about the court's decision and whether the administration had a plan to move forward, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: "Obviously this is something just announced.The Department of Justice has it, theyre reviewing it and Id refer you to them for any specific questions."
Former Trump adviser pleads guilty to lying about Russia contacts:::::One of President Trump's former campaign advisers has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents who are investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, the Department of Justice said Monday.George Papadopoulos, the 30-year-old foreign policy adviser, was arrested in July and pleaded guilty earlier this month, according to court filings unsealed on Monday.The Justice Department unsealed the documents shortly after it announced charges against two other higher-ranking Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.The charges stem from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.Prosecutors charged Papadopoulos with lying to investigators about his conversations with a foreign professor who told him that Russians had thousands of emails containing "dirt" on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE.He allegedly lied about his contact with a Russian woman whom the Justice Department says he worked with "in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials."Papadopoulos initially identified the woman as Russian President Vladimir Putin's niece, but later found out she was not related to Putin.Papadopoulos allegedly told the FBI that those conversations happened before he joined the Trump campaign, statements rebutted by the Justice Department's timeline.Charging documents paint a picture of Papadopolous as eager to leverage his relationships with the professor and the Russian woman as part of his role with the Trump campaign.He told a group of fellow foreign policy advisers and Trump himself during a spring 2016 meeting that he could use his connections to broker a meeting between Trump and Putin, authorities said.To that end, Papadopoulos allegedly emailed a Russian with connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding information from the correspondences to a top campaign official not identified in the documents.On numerous occasions, he tried to negotiate a meeting with either Trump or campaign officials and "members of President Putin's office" as well as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, officials said.Those meetings never occurred, but officials in the Trump campaign appeared to encourage his efforts.When Papadopolous told one campaign official about his early attempts to work with the professor and the Russian woman to orchestrate a meeting, the supervisor told him in an email: "Great work."The campaign supervisor also encouraged him to take an "off the record" meeting with Russian officials "if it is feasible," according to the emails A second campaign official at one point said Trump himself shouldn't take any trip to meet with the Russians; instead, "it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."While Papadopolous disclosed the meeting with the professor to FBI agents during a January interview, he told them that they spoke before he joined Trump's campaign, authorities said, adding that he sought to play down his own interest in the professor's claims because he thought the man was "BS'ing" him.According to authorities, Papadopoulos told them about the professor: "This isn't like he's messaging me while I'm in April with Trump.""This was a year ago, this was before I even got with Trump."But the FBI found that the meetings happened after Papadopoulos had been told he would join the campaign and that the professor's interest in him only stemmed from his position with Trump's campaign.He also allegedly made a similar claim about his relationship with the Russian woman, arguing that he had only exchanged pleasantries with her when he had in fact emailed her about arranging meetings between the Russians and Trump representatives.Following his interview with the FBI, authorities say Papadopoulos deactivated the Facebook account that had information about his conversations with both the professor and the Russian with connections to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.He also changed his cell phone number.Papadopoulos's name emerged in media reports back in August, after The Washington Post uncovered internal emails he sent offering to broker a meeting with the campaign and the Russians.The Post reported at the time that Trump aides didn't warm to the idea, with some top officials raising concerns that a meeting could either violate federal law or reflect poorly on the campaign.The former Trump aide faces up to five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and supervised release as part of a plea deal with the government.But the agreement notes that prosecutors estimate he'll serve no more than six months in jail and face a fine between $500 to $9,500 as long as he isn't found to have committed any additional crimes.His plea deal could open the door for further cooperation with the special counsel's investigation, something noted on Twitter by former U.S. District Attorney Preet Bharara, a vocal Trump critic who was fired by the president.Special Counsel Mueller appears to have a cooperating witness, George Papadopoulos.That is significant.Time will tell how significant.Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) October 30, 2017 This report was updated at 12:37 a.m.

Five things to know about the Manafort indictment:::::President Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort surrendered to the FBI on Monday morning.Manafort and his business associate Richard Gates are accused of money laundering and tax evasion on tens of millions of dollars they made while secretly lobbying for a political party in Ukraine.ADVERTISEMENT Although the sprawling 31-page indictment is a major milestone in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation, it doesnt actually mention President Trump.Here are five things to know about the indictment: Manafort was secretly lobbying for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.Manafort and Gates are alleged to have conducted a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign on behalf of a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine and its now-exiled leader, Viktor Yanukovych.Manafort and Gates never registered with the Justice Department as foreign lobbyists, as is required by law.The indictment details the extensive foreign lobbying work they conducted over the course of a decade, as well as the lengths they went to keep their work shielded from public scrutiny.The indictment says that Manaforts foreign lobbying work continued through 2016, although the indictment does not mention the six months he spent running Trumps campaign.In 2005, Manafort launched a political consulting group called Davis Manafort Partners with staff in the U.S., Ukraine and Russia.The group lobbied members of Congress and their staffs on Ukrainian sanctions and elections and briefed them on allegations against Yanukovych and his Party of Regions.Yanukovych was elected president of Ukraine in 2010.In 2012, a group called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine materialized in Belgium.The indictment describes the group as a mouthpiece for Yanukovych and his government, and claims that Manafort and Gates used it as a go-between for Yanukovychs government and U.S. entities with interests in Ukraine.Yanukovych fled Ukraine in exile in 2014 amid protests and allegations of widespread corruption.All told, the Justice Department indictment claims that Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered foreign agents on behalf of Yanukovych and his Party of Regions renamed the Opposition Bloc in 2014 from 2006 to 2016.They allegedly used more than 30 entities in the U.S. and Cypress to hide their activities.When confronted with the allegations of unregistered foreign lobbying, the Justice Department says Manafort and Gates lied or provided misleading statements about their activities.Manafort allegedly used offshore accounts to launder money from his foreign lobbying.Manafort and Gates made tens of millions of dollars lobbying on behalf of Yanukovych and his allies.The indictment alleges that they funneled those gains more than $75 million through foreign bank accounts opened by themselves and their accomplices in Cyprus, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Seychelles.Manafort and Gates are alleged to have hidden the income from the IRS, reporting on their taxes that they did not hold foreign bank accounts.The Justice Department lays out scores of specific transactions originating abroad that the government says Manafort used stateside to fund his lavish lifestyle.He is also accused of using the offshore accounts to defraud banks by taking out mortgages that made him appear to have more liquid assets than he actually had, enabling him to obtain better interest rates on loans.'Conspiracy against the U.S.' is among the 12 charges Manafort faces.Manafort and Gates are both accused of committing conspiracy against the United States between 2006 and 2017 a revelation that threatened to set off immediate alarm bells in Washington.But the charge, as with the others laid out in the indictment, is related to their financial dealings, particularly the work that Manafort and Gates did overseas on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and their effort to launder money and evade taxes.The charge does not constitute an accusation of collusion with a foreign power and is not related to work either party did for the Trump campaign.According to the indictment, Manafort and Gates together with others, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions of a government agency, namely the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury standard language used in federal tax crimes.In addition to conspiracy and money laundering charges, the two also face charges of acting as unregistered agents of a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements about their overseas work, and failing to file the correct paperwork in connection with their foreign bank and financial accounts.Manafort lived a lavish lifestyle.The indictment explains how Manafort used his overseas income to support a lavish lifestyle in the United States that included multimillion-dollar real estate purchases, shopping sprees at luxury clothing stores, and high-end car purchases at Range Rover and Mercedes Benz.In sum, Manafort is accused of laundering $18 million.Manafort, without reporting the income to his tax preparer or the United States, spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors, the indictment states.For instance, Manafort secretly wired more than $5 million to a company in the Hamptons for home improvement work between 2008 and 2014.He spent nearly $1 million on antique rugs at a store in Alexandria, Va.; more than $1.3 million at clothing stores in New York and Beverly Hills; and more than $800,000 on landscaping.According to the indictment, Manafort used his overseas funds to purchase three properties in 2012, including a condo in New York, a brownstone in New York, and a house in Arlington, Va., just outside Washington.These real estate purchases totaled $6.4 million.The indictment says Manafort borrowed millions of dollars from lenders using his properties as collateral, thereby allowing him to get cash in the U.S. without reporting his income or paying taxes on it.In order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United States, Manafort defrauded the institutions that loaned money on these properties so that they would lend him more money at more favorable rates than he would otherwise be able to obtain, the indictment states.There is no mention of the Trump campaign in the indictment.Mueller is ostensibly investigating whether President Trumps campaign officials colluded with Russians during the 2016 presidential race, but Trump and his campaign are not mentioned once in the indictment.Trump has already seized on the indictment as proof there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow, pointing to the fact that it deals with Manaforts work prior to the campaign.Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign, Trump tweeted Monday morning.Also, there is NO COLLUSION!Still, Manafort led Trumps campaign in some capacity from March through August 2016 and the allegations in the indictment indicate that Manafort is accused of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia political party from 2005 through 2016.That has sparked speculation that Mueller is seeking to first build an air-tight case surrounding the financial crimes of Trumps associates with the hope of later squeezing them to dish about alleged collusion as part of a deal.Mueller was given broad authority by the Justice Department to investigate not only potential links between the Trump campaign and Moscow but also any matters that arose as a result of the probe.As a high-level campaign associate, Manafort theoretically could provide valuable information to prosecutors as they seek to find evidence of collusion between the campaign and the Russian government.
Schumer warns Trump: Don't interfere in Mueller probe:::::Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump's tax plan and the certainty of Democratic resistance Dems cheer Flake after scathing Trump speech Cruz throws support behind Roy Moore in Alabama Senate race MORE (D-N.Y.) is warning President Trump not to interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was charged as part of the probe.The President must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsels work in any way.If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues," Schumer said in a statement.He added that "the rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded."Manafort has been charged with 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, according to the special counsel's office.Manaforts former business partner and proteg, Rick Gates, who was ousted from the pro-Trump group America First Policies in April, has also been charged.ADVERTISEMENT The charges are related to work done by Manafort and Gates on behalf of a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.Trump has previously flirted with firing Mueller, sparking bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill.Two groups of senators have introduced legislation that would limit Trump's ability to fire Mueller, or have the Justice Department fire him, without a court's approval.And Democrats have warned Trump against trying to pardon individuals caught up in the investigation.Sen.

President Trump Is Blaming Chuck Schumer for the New York City Terrorist Attack:::::(WASHINGTON) President Donald Trump called Wednesday for Merit Based immigration following the deadly truck attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured 11.Trump said on Twitter that the driver in Tuesdays attack came into our country through what is called the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, a Chuck Schumer beauty.Officials said the attacker is an immigrant from Uzbekistan who came to the U.S. legally in 2010.They havent said whether he came in through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. Trump tweeted, We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader who represents New York, soon hit back, saying in a statement, I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America.He faulted Trump for politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy.Schumer said the President should focus on the real solution anti-terrorism funding an area that Schumer says Trump has proposed cutting in his most recent budget.
Facebook, Google and Twitter Pledge to Revise Ad Policies:::::Representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter told lawmakers that they would revise ad policies after Russian influence operations, but they did not endorse legislation that would standardize transparency rules in online advertising.Appearing before a Senate subcommittee on crime and terrorism, the three executives seemed contrite as they admitted publicly that foreign actors used their tools to distort conversation and exploit political divides in the months before and after the presidential election last November.We saw an effort to sow division and discord in the wake of the election, said Colin Stretch, general counsel for Facebook.We saw a lot of activity fomenting discord about the validity of his election.Stretch appeared alongside Sean Edgett, acting general counsel for Twitter, and Richard Salgado, Googles director of law enforcement and information security for the first in two days of hearings on Russias use of online media to influence the 2016 presidential election.Throughout the questioning on Tuesday afternoon, the executives provided a sharper image of how Russian operatives used social media to their political advantage.Russian actors, among them the prominent troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency, launched Facebook pages with names like Black Matters U.S. and United Muslims of America, masquerading as representatives of hot-button political topics.On Twitter, duplicitous accounts targeted Clinton supporters, attempting to convince them they could vote via text message.Its what makes this content so vile, so upsetting, so cynical its attempt to exploit divisions in our society, Stretch said apologetically.The conversation frequently came back to political advertisements on social media, a device of foreign interference in the 2016 election.Facebook has already submitted around 3,000 Russian-linked advertisements to congressional investigators.The executives who appeared before the committee on Tuesday pledged that they had and would continue to revise their advertising policy, but stopped short of pledging their respective companies support for legislation that would standardize transparency rules in social media advertising.I dont think its enough, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has backed such a bill, said during the hearing.We wont have actual enforcement.I think its very important that we have the same rules of the road for candidate ads and issue ads.The 12 senators who presided over the committee had little patience for empty answers.I think you do enormous good, but your power sometimes scares me, said Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana.
'All of Our Leaders Have Flaws.' White House Defends John Kelly's Comments on Robert E. Lee:::::The White House defended Tuesday Chief of Staff John Kellys remarks that the Civil War happened because of the lack of an ability to compromise and that Confederate general Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.Speaking at the daily press briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated previous defenses of historical figures from the Confederacy which came up after President Trump made similar points in August.All of our leaders have flaws, Sanders told reporters.That doesnt diminish their contributions to our country, and it certainly cant erase them from our history.General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isnt perfect, it doesnt mean its not our history.Kellys comment on Fox Monday evening that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand, echoed various comments by Trump on the Civil War and racism in America.Trump said in May that Andrew Jackson could have made a deal to prevent the Civil War; he was roundly criticized in August for saying that there was blame on both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia; and he has argued that statues of Confederate leaders should not be taken down.Sanders said Tuesday that it is outrageous and absurd for the press to push that this is a racially charged and divided White House, and she mirrored the presidents own language on Civil War history.Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments, Trump tweeted in August, You cant change history, but you can learn from it.There are moments that we are going to be a lot less proud of than others, Sanders said, but we cant erase the fact that they happened.
George Papadopolous Posted an Old Photo on Twitter and People Called Him Out:::::A week ago, on October 25, Donald Trumps former foreign policy advisor, George Papadopolous, appears to have posted a photo of himself on Twitter wearing a suit and standing the streets of London with the caption: #business.There are two things that are weird about that post.First, we now know that less than three weeks before he posted that happy-go-lucky pic of himself, he pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents in an investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and become what called a proactive cooperator in the ongoing case.And second, that photo wasnt even taken in 2017.Or 2016.Or maybe not even 2015, for that matter.Thanks to the great deductive powers of internet sleuths like Aric Toler and Alex Billig, we have pretty good reason to believe that the photo was actually taken sometime before May 2015.One major giveaway is that all the stuff in the background of the photo has changed in the intervening years.A close analysis of Google Street View, which provides time-stamped images of popular street scenes, indicates, for example, that the stickers on a light pole behind Papadopoulos in the photo were removed sometime between July 2014 and May 2015.So if he was standing in front of those stickers on that pole, it definitely wasnt in October 2017.Another red flag is that if you do a reverse Google Image Search of the photograph, it pops up in a Romanian news article from September 30, 2016.We dont know why Papadopoulos posted the old picture.Maybe he wanted to present a positive image to everyone who he knew was going to be looking him up online.If thats the case, it worked.With his name making headlines, this old picture is all over the news.
Barack and Michelle Speak Live at Obama Foundation Summit:::::Chicago on Tuesday will play host to the Obama Foundations first summit, a two-day gathering designed to inspire a new generation of leaders.The summit will feature around 500 speakers and performers, with grassroots leaders participating alongside big names such as Prince Harry and Chance the Rapper.Whether youre an artist or entrepreneur, organizer or civil servant, youre here because youve demonstrated the passion, optimism, and devotion we need to move the world forward, wrote former President Barack Obama in a welcome note to attendees.The Obama Foundation will seek to inspire people everywhere to give back, get involved, and recognize that they, too, have the power to make a difference.And that mission depends on more than what you do this weekit depends on you taking what you learn this week back to your communities, and applying it over the dedicated work of a lifetime.Delegates from 60 countries and 27 U.S. states will attend the summit, as well as 102 native Chicagoans and Barack and Michelle Obama themselves.Watch Barack and Michelle Obama give a welcome address live above at 4 p.m.ET.The pair will speak as the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election intensified Monday with the arrest of several allies of President Donald Trump.
John Kelly's Latest Snafu Shows He Thinks a Lot Like Trump:::::He has joked about hurting journalists.He harshly criticized a black congresswoman, got his facts wrong, then refused to apologize.And this week he argued that Confederate statues should not be taken down, calling Robert E. Lee an honorable man.That wasnt President Donald Trump.That was his chief of staff, John Kelly, a former Marine general who has been seen as the last, best hope for the White House to become more effective.But Kellys public statements in recent weeks have shown that he agrees more with Trumps view of the world than either his critics or his supporters previously thought.Heres a quick look at some of their agreements.The United States faces constant threats from terrorism Trump regularly talks about the major threat that the United States faces from radical Islamic terrorism.After federal judges blocked a version of his travel ban in February, he tweeted: The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East.Courts must act fast!In an interview on Fox and Friends in May, Kelly said that the threat of terrorism is constant and nonstop.I was telling Steve on the way in here if he knew what I know about terrorism hed never leave the house in the morning, Kelly said, referring to the Fox host Steve Doocy.Asked if he meant those remarks tongue in cheek, he doubled down: There are incredible plots against the United States, terrorism plots against the United States, he said later.America used to be a better place Trumps campaign slogan was Make America Great Again.Hes often spoken about the good old days when he claims that law enforcement was tougher on criminals, argued that when he was in high school and college everybody used to say we never lost a war and said that people stopped saying Merry Christmas because it wasnt politically correct.Kelly has also lamented that America has changed, although his exact comments were different.When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country, he said at a news conference.He argued that women were sacred and looked upon with great honor when he was younger, that the dignity of life was held in higher esteem and that religion, that seems to be gone as well.Journalists are not your friend Trump regularly attacks the press, arguing reporters are tremendously dishonest and that its frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.He likes to joke about his dislike of the media, making a crack about their unattractiveness during a recent Halloween event for reporters children in the Oval Office.Like many chiefs of staff before him, Kelly has sought to more strictly control press access to the White House in the name of discipline.At a Coast Guard graduation in May, Kelly, then the head of Homeland Security, joked with Trump after he received a ceremonial saber: Use that on the press, sir.It was a lighthearted moment, but it may have showed a similar view of the press.Rep. Frederica Wilson is not a good person After Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson criticized Trumps handling of a phone call with a military widow, Trump went on the attack, calling her wacky and arguing that lawmakers like her are killing the Democrat Party.He then doubled down, again calling her wacky and arguing that she is a disaster for Dems and the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party.At a White House press briefing in October, Kelly criticized Wilson as an empty barrel and said he was stunned and appalled that she took credit for getting funding for a building at an event he attended in Miami.The Miami Herald found video that showed Kelly got the facts wrong, but on Monday Kelly stood by his comments saying he would never apologize.Confederate statues should not be taken down In an interview in May, Trump argued the Civil War could have been prevented if leaders like Andrew Jackson had been alive to work out a compromise.In a press conference in August, Trump argued that statues honoring Confederate leaders should not be taken down, saying that would lead to statues of other historical figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson being taken down as well.In an interview on Monday, Kelly called Confederate general Robert E. Lee an honorable man, said that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and argued that it would be a mistake to take down Confederate statues because it would lead to unfair reassessments of historical figures like Christopher Columbus.I think it shows you just how much of a lack of appreciate of history and what history is, he said.
Manafort Indictment and the Foreign Agents Registration Act:::::When the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday released a federal grand jurys indictment of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, as part of Special Counsel Robert S. Muellers probe into suspected Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the charges spoke to a long-running worry among U.S. lawmakers.Among the 12 charges, Manafort is accused of acting as a unregistered agent of a foreign principal and issuing false and misleading FARA statements, by not properly disclosing the nature of the consulting he did for a Kremlin-linked Ukrainian political party.Failure to do so would be a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a registration requirement that makes foreign agents tell the DOJ whom theyre working for, what theyre doing, and how much theyre getting paid for the gig.Fear of foreign interference in U.S. affairs is about as old as the U.S., but this 1938 law is a response to a specific fear: Americans in the U.S. working for the Nazis.One of those Americans was famously suspected to be Ivy Lee.Hes often now viewed as a father of public relations, but back in the early 1930s it was one of his clients in particular that interested observers.As the publicist for the U.S. affiliate of the chemical product giant Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie (Farben), which TIME described as the great German dye trust, he had been hired to help the European company gain a larger foothold in the U.S. in the early days of global corporations.Quickly, however, the nature of the job began to change.When Germany nationalizes the corporations, the distinction between state and corporation blurs, explains Jonathan Auerbach, author of Weapons of Democracy: Propaganda, Progressivism, and American Public Opinion.So when Farben is taken over by the German nationalist state, hes advising Germany.In January 1934, Lee met briefly with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Propaganda Ministry director Joseph Goebbels.Though the exact details of what Goebbels and Hitler wanted out of Lee are not clear, Auerbach believes what they may have been seeking from Ivy Lee was some insight into how Americans think about Nazis and to talk about what they could do to make Americans think more positively about Nazis.That July, a forerunner to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) made public testimony Lee had given about that meeting.The committee, which was originally founded to look into German influence over American public opinion, wanted to know if he was conspiring on something with the Nazis.After all, Lee got a raise so huge after Hitler came into power from $3,000 to $25,000 that the committee got the impression that Mr. Lee might just as well have been retained by the Reichskanzler himself, TIME reported in its July 23, 1934, issue.Heres how the magazine quoted Lees side of the story: I have told them repeatedly, testified Mr. Lee, that ...the dissemination of, the organization of, German propaganda in the U. S. was just a mistake and futile.That it was bad business.That complete reliance should be placed on getting news to the American people through normal channels of publicity.I told them that there were certain policies which Germany had [on Jews] which were bound to antagonize American public opinion and to attempt to secure favorable American opinion toward themsuch attempts would be futile and, in the second place, objectionable.In the very beginning I stipulated that there should be no dissemination whatever by me of information in the U. S. ...I never distribute anything for clients in my name.My position is that every client of mine must tell his own story and do his own job in a responsible open way....Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter According to TIMEs summary, Lee admitted Germany wasnt the first government he had advised (he had also done work for Poland and Romania).That was not unusual, according to Auerbach.Some of the regions newly independent after World War I hired Americans, whom they saw as the greatest publicity people, going back to P.T.Barnum, to help gain international support.When those governments hired them, there was generally no restriction on what those agents could do.(For example, two other PR pioneers, Edward Bernays and Carl Byoir, helped generate public support to pressure the U.S. Senate to recognize Lithuania.)Soon enough, however, the practice began to raise eyebrows in Washington.The congressmen were really interested in this peculiar notion of a foreign agent that you can be working on behalf of a foreign government without anyone knowing it and I think that led to the 1938 act [FARA], argues Auerbach.What does it mean for a private citizen to be giving information or advice to a government about your own country?Lee argued that, as long as there was complete transparency, the pressagents who helped smooth international relations were doing positive work.And Congress would essentially drop its investigation into his doings a few months later, when Lee died of a brain tumor on Nov. 9, 1934.But after his death, suspicions of German Americans only grew.FARA was enacted in 1938 after the Institute of Propaganda Analysis was founded in 1937 to help intelligent citizens detect and analyze propaganda, and as the pro-Nazi German American Bund tried to gin up American support for neutrality in the European conflict that would become World War II.As Stephen I. Vladeck, an expert in national security law and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, sums up the rationale for FARA at the time, The idea from Congress was, Listen, were not going to say you cant come and participate in our political process, but if youre going to lobby for policies or pay Americans to do that on your behalf the American people ought to know about it, and make their own decision about the wisdom or lack there of, of the policy.'The hope was that public relations agencies and lobbyists wouldnt carry out something unethical if they had to publicly disclose the relationship.FARA didnt stop people from working as foreign agents, and in fact, the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act became a way to get around FARA because those who met the statutes easier to satisfy requirements were exempt from FARA, according to Vladeck.Nowadays, the DOJ usually gives offenders a chance to submit the paperwork belatedly in lieu of prosecuting them because it had been considered overly harsh to prosecute people for what was ultimately a paperwork transgression, he says.I think the purpose of the statute has endured, says Vladeck.The concern about foreign involvement in U.S. politics never went away.
Donald Trump Says George Papadopoulos Is a Liar:::::(WASHINGTON) President Donald Trump says a campaign adviser who has admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries was a low level volunteer who was proven to be a liar.Trump on Twitter Tuesday sought to distance himself from George Papadopoulos: Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.Court documents say Papadopoulos was approached by people claiming ties to Russia and offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the conversations.Court papers unsealed Monday also revealed an indictment against Trumps former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.Trump said the allegations happened long before he joined the campaign.But the indictment details allegations stretching from 2006 to 2017.
John Kelly Praised Robert E. Lee and Said 'Lack of Compromise' Led to the Civil War:::::White House Chief of Staff John Kelly lauded Confederate general Robert E. Lee and said the Civil War began as a result of lack of compromise, inserting himself into a debate over the value of Confederate statues and monuments around the country.President Donald Trumps chief of staff made the comments on conservative commentator Laura Ingrahams new Fox News show on Monday evening.I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man, Kelly said.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now its different today.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.In the interview, which also touched on the indictments made Monday by a federal grand jury of Paul Manafort, the Trump campaigns former chairman, and his longtime business partner, Kelly shared his thoughts on how Americans view events from the past.I think we make a mistake, though, and as a society and certainly as individuals, when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100, 200, 300 years or more and say what those, you know, what Christopher Columbus did was wrong, Kelly said.You know, 500 years later, its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then.The former Marine generals comments were met with criticism on social media, where some said there is no compromise with slavery and others compared his remarks with those made by the president in the past.Ta-Nehisi Coates, a prominent writer and MacArthur Genius grant recipient, posted a thread on Twitter analyzing the different compromises made on enslavement from Americas founding, including, among others, the Three-Fifths Compromise.Shocking that someone charged with defending their country, in some profound way, does not comprehend the country they claim to defend, Coates wrote.Notion that we are putting todays standards on the past is, in itself, racistimplies only white, slave-holding, opinions matter.Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote that what Kelly said was irresponsible & dangerous.Others pointed out how they echoed Trumps comments following the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August, where one woman died after a man drove his car into a group of counter-protesters.Then, Trump cited violence on many sides as white nationalists rallied to protect the Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee.In his comments following the aftermath of the violent clash, Trump also said racism is evil.
Study Shows How Climate Change Damages Health:::::IDEAS Espinosa is the executive secretary of UN Climate Change and Horton is editor-in-chief of The Lancet The evidence is growing harder and harder to ignoreclimate change is already having a profound and detrimental impact on public health.Around the world, warmer temperatures are creating and complicating a whole host of health challenges, many of which have been all too obvious this year.As over 20,000 delegates from around the world prepare to meet in Bonn, Germany, for the annual UN climate conference, the unnaturally warm surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean have helped produce a historically high run of 10 named hurricanes this season, which have taken lives and destroyed communities from Texas to the Caribbean to Ireland.Many parts of Europe sweltered this summer under a heat wave that was so bad that it was dubbed Lucifer.The American Southwest was meanwhile suffering through its own historic heat.And then came the wildfires, sparked on drought-scorched lands in Western Europe, the Pacific Northwest, and California.A report published this week by The Lancet, one of the worlds most prestigious medical journals, provides an annual check up of how climate change is impacting public health, and how countries actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are reducing health risks.The research, conducted by a group of leading doctors, academics, and policy professionals found that climate change is already damaging the health of millions worldwide.How?The deaths caused by unnatural disasters like warming-fueled hurricanes and wildfires are obvious, and the threat of extreme heat waves which can kill outright or cause heat-related illnesses to public health is clear.But there are many other climate impacts that are every bit as sinister, and potentially lethal.Changing weather patterns are already altering the transmission patterns of infectious diseases, resulting in unexpected outbreaks of malaria, dengue fever, cholera, tick-born encephalitis, and West Nile virus.Allergy season is getting longer and allergen levels higher.Lyme disease is spreading, with the number of cases in the United States tripling over the past two decades as deer ticks can carry the disease farther north and as warmer temperatures allow them to Floods, which are increasing in regularity and severity, create even more breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects.Uneven, unpredictable precipitation patterns and higher temperatures are also reducing crop yields, causing more widespread malnourishment and nutrition deficiencies.Tragically, these burdens are being and will be borne mostly by children, the elderly and low-income vulnerable populations that have done little to cause climate change and have benefited the least from the burning of fossil fuels.But make no mistake, the impacts will be felt by all.Perhaps most troubling, what were experiencing today is just the beginning.Over the past few decades, the global health community has made great gains in tackling the spread and sources of infectious disease, and in combatting malnutrition and hunger.But this progress could be undermined in a warming world that exacerbates such health threats.Its a dire diagnosis, but the good news is that we know the cure.We simply must stop burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, transitioning to clean, renewable energy resources.Whats more, many of the steps we take to combat climate change can create immediate benefit public health in other ways.Fine particulate matter and other local air pollution in cities from tailpipes and coal plants, for instance kills some 2.6 million people annually worldwide, according to the Lancet Countdown.Solving the greenhouse gas problem also cleans up the smoggy air thats polluting lungs.These longer term and immediate health factors are why the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change called a comprehensive response to climate change the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.Policymakers recognize climate change as being a massive public health challenge and not just an environmental one and act accordingly.The Lancet Countdowns annual reports can help quantify the full costs to the public, and should be utilized to drive more ambitious efforts to transition to a low carbon future.There are encouraging signs that this is starting to happen.The two-week climate conference, opening on November 6, has health among its key priority issues.For the 25 years that the global community has been working to find a way to collectively combat climate change, not nearly enough has been known about the true risks to public health.We can no longer use that ignorance as an excuse for inaction.Were seeing the impacts now, and they are measurable.Without aggressive action, the public health problems were seeing today risk intensifying to a widespread health emergency.With ambitious action, however, we can both rein in long term warming and by cleaning the air of fossil fuel-borne pollutionwe can start improving health and saving lives right away.
Manafort Carried 3 US Passports, Had Ties to Russian Oligarchs:::::Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, had three U.S. passports, millions in assets and ties to Russian oligarchs, according to federal court documents after his indictment on tax fraud and money laundering charges.Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and "their history of deceptive and misleading conduct," federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trump's campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraines former pro-Russian government.The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller's 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor and potential collusion by campaign aides.The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mens' work on Trump's campaign.The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates."Both defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government," according to the government's memorandum in support of the conditions of release."And both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates."Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas.Manafort submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said.Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client "looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury."The memo said Manafort's financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from from $19 million to $136 million.Manafort and Gates owned or controlled entities and accounts worldwide including in Cyprus, Grenadines, Seychelles and England, it said.
Poll: 56 Percent of Americans Want to See Tax Hikes for Large Corporations:::::A majority of Americans want tax increases for large corporations and for the wealthy, according to a new CBS News poll.Here are the highlights from the survey: 56 percent want tax increases for large corporations, while 17 percent say the taxes should be cut.24 percent want taxes on large corporations kept the same.58 percent say the wealthy should have their taxes increased, while 12 percent say they should be reduced.29 percent believe taxes on the wealthy should be kept the same.4 percent want taxes on small businesses increased, compared to 68 percent who want them cut.Another 27 percent want taxes on small businesses kept the same.3 percent say they want taxes on the middle class increased, while 60 percent want the taxes decreased.36 percent say they should be kept the same.CBS News noted most do not believe any tax cuts that help large corporations would help them personally.Here is how the rest of the survey breaks down: 54 percent of those polled believe cutting taxes in general would help grow the economy, while 40 percent do not.77 percent of Republicans say reducing the tax rate would help the economy, compared to 17 percent who do not.42 percent of Democrats believe cutting taxes would help the economy grow, while 54 percent disagree.49 percent of independents say reducing the tax rate would help the economy, compared to 44 percent who disagree.The poll, which surveyed 1,109 people, was conducted Oct. 27-30.The total results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Sen. Warren: Supreme Court Doesn't Have Ethics Code, But It Should:::::The Supreme Court is the only federal court in the land that doesn't have a formal code of conduct for its justices, notable because the High Court has an ethics problem, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote in a column for Politico.Supreme Court justices aren't bound by the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, given that the High Court was established by the Constitution, not by Congress.So justices may consult the code, but their decision to abide by it is voluntary, and Warren takes issue with that."When an ethical cloud hangs over the court, its fundamental integrity is compromised.At a time when Gallup polls have found that fewer than half of Americans approve of the way the court is handling its job, the justices ought to be making every effort to show that their personal integrity is above reproach," Warren writes.Warren cites Justice Neil Gorsuch giving a speech to a group that had a stake in a Supreme Court case, and three justices including Chief Justice John Roberts who own shares in 53 publicly traded companies as examples of ethical issues that mar the credibility of the court.Warren's out to change that, co-sponsoring a bill the Supreme Court Ethics Act that would compel the "Supreme Court to adopt an ethical code.""It is time to begin rebuilding American's confidence in the court by establishing a formal code of conduct," Warren wrote."The Supreme Court has an even greater duty to set the example for courts around the country and demonstrate that its decisions are based on a fair and unbiased assessment of the facts and the law, not personal biases or their own financial interests."Eliminating ethical questions and conflicts of interests should be the starting point," Warren wrote.
Prosecutor in Manafort Case Called Ethical, Tough:::::Paul Manafort can expect to get a fair deal from the aggressive lead prosecutor in the case against President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, according to former colleagues and some defense attorneys."If there's something to find, he'll find it.If there's nothing there, he's not going to cook something up," Katya Jestin, a former colleague in the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, told The New York Times in a profile of Andrew Weissmann.A civil rights lawyer credited Weissmann with ordering a review of hundreds of convictions based on faulty forensic testimony."He realized that what had gone on in the past was wrong.He did it.That was transformative," said Peter Neufeld, a founder of the Innocence Project.Some defense attorneys who have tangled with Weissmann, who has locked up mob bosses and white-collar criminals, criticized his scorched-earth techniques but did not question his ethics."I'm no fan of Donald Trump.Frankly, I can't think of two people who deserve each other more than Andrew Weissman," said Dan Cogdell, who defended clients when Weissmann prosecuted the Enron Corp. scandal in the early 2000s.However, Sidney Powell, a writer and lawyer, has criticized Weissmann for abusing his power, especially as part of the legal team in the Enron case."The Enron Task Force prosecutors ran roughshod over the rights of countless people in their pursuit of convictions rather than justice," he wrote in the Observer.
WSJ: GOP Tax Plan Keeps Top Tax Rate at 39.6 Percent:::::As the House Republican leadership delayed the release of their tax plan by at least one day in an attempt to iron out differences, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that a top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent will be maintained.The GOP had originally been considering a cut in the top rate to 33 percent, or at least to 35 percent.Although the idea now is to keep the rate the same, the top bracket would possibly cover a smaller segment of the population.Democrats have been particularly vocal in criticizing Republicans for a tax plan that largely benefits the wealthy, as the proposal also sharply reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and repeals the estate tax, which next year was supposed to only pertain to those estates worth more than $5.6 million The GOP delayed the release of the plan's detail in an effort to iron out differences over these and other thorny issues, such as how to treat deductions for state and local taxes.Repealing those deductions would harm many in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republican colleagues from her state who are supporting the plan of "looting" California taxpayers by increasing the tax burden on middle class families, The Mercury News reported.Republicans are eager to fast-track the bill through the House by Thanksgiving and get it to the president's desk for signing by the end of the year, according to The Wall Street Journal.But once the details of the plan are fully known, opponents of getting rid of one tax break or another are sure to criticize, and questions remain over how much the proposal will increase the deficit.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the bill's chief author, remained optimistic, however, after consulting with House leaders and President Donald Trump on the plan's timetable."We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our committee beginning next week," he said.
Poll: Opposition Rises to Corporate Tax Cut:::::Voters' opposition to a corporate tax rate cut has increased, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.The results: 41 percent of voters said that a corporate tax rate cut should not be part of the tax reform plan proposed by President Donald Trump and Republican leaders.39 percent said the cut should be part of the plan.The 41-percent amount is up from 38 percent that opposed the cut in a Politico/Morning Consult poll, Politico's report said.Breaking down the results along party lines: 59 percent of Republicans support the cut.55 percent of Democrats oppose it.42 percent of independent voters oppose the cut.Support remains steady for the tax reform plan overall, unchanged since a similar poll in October.48 percent of voters "strongly support" or "somewhat support" the tax reform plan.37 percent oppose the plan.Breaking down the results by party affiliation: 83 percent of Republican voters support it.24 percent of Democrats support it.39 percent of independent voters support the plan.The corporate rate cut proposal would decrease the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, Politico reported.The online survey was conducted among 1,990 voters from Oct. 26 to Oct. 30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Trump Rejecting Pressure to Fire Mueller — For Now:::::All indications are that for now, President Donald Trump is going to stay the course and do nothing when it comes to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, according to reports.That is, the president continues to reject pressure from former chief strategist Steve Bannon and allies outside the White House to fire Mueller."The thinking is, 'You will take the same abuse whether you go after (Mueller) or you don't,'" CNN quoted one source.But while Bannon is off advocating firing Mueller or pulling his funding, legal advisers to the president scoff at that, saying Trump has no intention of doing either."This is Bannon's wishful thinking," one person close to the president told CNN."It's never going to happen.It's just not going to happen.""The die has been set," White House attorney Ty Cobb said Tuesday, Politico reported."I think our approach has clearly been of assistance and moving us along quickly to free the country from this investigation as expeditiously as possible."That also means not attacking Mueller and his investigation, Politico reported."I don't support any kind of retaliatory action," Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow told Politico."That's not the position we're advocating.We're cooperating with the special counsel."But who knows if and when that will change with an unpredictable president, still privately reeling from Monday's indictments of three former campaign aides, including chairman Paul Manafort."He's insane about it because he's wondering how many of these things are there, out there, that I don't know about?"a person close to the president told CNN.
Pruitt Guts EPA Science Panels, Will Appoint New Members:::::The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday he intends to replace the outside experts that advise him on science and public health issues with new board members holding more diverse views.In announcing the changes, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt suggested many previously appointed to the panels were potentially biased because they had received federal research grants.The 22 boards advise EPA on a wide range of issues, including drinking water standards and pesticide safety."Whatever science comes out of EPA shouldn't be political science," said Pruitt, a Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma."From this day forward, EPA advisory committee members will be financially independent from the agency."Pruitt has expressed skepticism about the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary cause of global warming.He also overruled experts that had recommended pulling a top-selling pesticide from the market after peer-reviewed studies showed it damaged children's brains.Pruitt said he will name new leadership and members to three key EPA advisory boards soon the Science Advisory Board, Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.It was not clear from the EPA's media release if all current board members serving out their appointed terms were immediately dismissed.EPA's press office did not respond to messages seeking clarification on Tuesday.As part of his directive, Pruitt said he will bar appointees who currently are in receipt of EPA grants or who are in a position to benefit such grants.He exempted people who work at state, local or tribal agencies, saying he wants to introduce more "geographic diversity" to the panels.The five-page policy Pruitt issued Tuesday makes no mention of other potential conflicts of interest, such as accepting research funding from corporate interests regulated by EPA.Tuesday's announcement comes after Pruitt in May said he would not reappoint nine of the 18 members of the Board of Scientific Counselors to serve a second three-year term, as had been customary.Current board chairwoman Deborah Swackhamer said the members were already required to follow rules intended to prevent conflicts of interests."It obviously stacks the deck against scientists who do not represent corporate special interests," said Swackhamer, a retired professor who taught environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota."It speaks volumes that people funded by special interests are OK to be advisers, but not those who have received federal grants."Senate Environment Committee Chairman John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who shares Pruitt's skepticism of mainstream climate science, cheered the move.He said EPA's science boards would now better reflect the views of rural states like his own.But environmentalists worried that Pruitt will now select board members with financial ties to the fossil fuel and chemical industries."The Trump EPA's continued attack on science will likely be one of the most lasting and damaging legacies of this administration," said Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that approves EPA's funding."Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters."
Bill Shielding Mueller From Trump Unlikely Soon in Senate:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exhibited no interest Tuesday in considering legislation shielding the special counsel from Donald Trump, even as Republicans warn the president against interfering with Robert Mueller's investigation.McConnell's remarks came as Trump has continued using Twitter to complain about the continued focus on "phony Trump/Russia" connections, instead of on Hillary Clinton and Democrats.They also came a day after Mueller's inquiry into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential race yielded a guilty plea and two indictments of Trump campaign officials.Two bipartisan bills were introduced months ago that would make it harder for a special counsel to be fired.After an initial flurry of support, the bills have stalled as Trump has softened his public criticism of Mueller."We've got plenty of things we have to do between now and the end of the year that will take up floor time," McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday when asked if he'd bring the measures to the Senate floor if Trump impedes Mueller's work.At one point, Trump's legal team looked into potential conflicts surrounding the team Mueller has hired, including the backgrounds of members and political contributions by some members of his team to Clinton.McConnell, who has expressed confidence in Mueller's work, said the Senate's role in the investigation is being performed by the chamber's Intelligence committee."That's our role in it, and special counsel has his job to do, and we're going to concentrate on what we're doing here," said McConnell.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a brief interview that he'd not asked McConnell to bring the bills protecting Mueller to the Senate floor, saying, "We'll see what happens."On Monday, Schumer called for swift congressional action should Trump interfere with the investigation.Legislation sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would prevent the firing of any special counsel unless the dismissal was first reviewed by a panel of three federal judges.Legislation co-sponsored by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., would let any Justice Department special counsel challenge their removal in court.The Senate GOP's No.2 leader complimented the guilty plea by George Papadopoulos for lying to FBI agents about Russian contacts."I think hopefully it will send a message to everybody else to cooperate with the investigation and to answer the FBI's questions and not to lie," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas."So I thought that was a very positive move from that standpoint."Other Republicans made clear their opposition to any presidential interference in Mueller's work, including Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., another GOP leader.Blunt said he wasn't concerned that Trump might take on Mueller more aggressively but added, "I'm also not for it."He said firing Mueller "would be a big mistake.""Everybody that I know does not think that's a good idea," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who's clashed with Trump, said of a Mueller firing."I don't know what the actual reaction would be if it happened.I doubt if it's going to, but I've been wrong almost every time."Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal lawyer, shot down the possibilities of firing Mueller and or the president pardoning people caught up in the probe."The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he has any intent on terminating Robert Mueller," Sekulow said in an interview Tuesday with ABC's "Good Morning America."On pardons, he said: "I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons.And pardons are not on the table."Besides Papadopoulos' guilty plea, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates have both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters after the charges were released that "there is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel."Lawmakers have been on guard since May, when Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey and Mueller was appointed.
Papadopoulos Claimed Trump Campaign Approved Russia Meeting:::::Former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos made a significant claim in an email: Top Trump campaign officials agreed to a pre-election meeting with representatives of Russian President Vladimir Putin.The message, if true, would bolster claims that Trump's campaign attempted to collude with Russian interests.But it's unclear whether Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was merely boasting when he sent the July 14, 2016, email to a Kremlin-linked contact.There's also no indication such a meeting ever occurred.The email is cited in an FBI agent's affidavit supporting criminal charges against Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy volunteer on Trump's campaign.But it's not included in court documents that detailed his secret guilty plea and his cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Mueller Probe The evidence gleaned during Papadopoulos's three months of cooperation could further advance Mueller's investigation into possible collusion by Trump's aides.This latest email, one of many unsealed on Monday, runs counter to the steadfast denials by Trump and his supporters that anyone attempted to work with the Russians.Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Papadopoulos, a low-level adviser that few people on the campaign knew, "has already proven to be a liar."Prosecutors didn't explain why the email wasn't included in the detailed admissions of Papadopoulos's wrongdoing, and it's possible they concluded the assertions weren't true.Writing to the Russian contact a week before the Republican National Convention, Papadopoulos proposed a meeting for August or September in the U.K. that would include "my national chairman and maybe one other foreign policy adviser" and members of Putin's office and Russia's foreign ministry."It has been approved by our side," Papadopoulos wrote.Campaign Officials Investigators don't identify campaign officials by name in the emails.Paul Manafort was the campaign chairman at the time, having taken over from Corey Lewandowski.Sam Clovis was the campaign's national co-chairman.Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were charged with conspiracy, money laundering and false statements about their political work on behalf of Ukrainians in an indictment that was also unsealed on Monday.Both men pleaded not guilty.Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, said that his client had rebuffed overtures to meet with Russians, and noted an email from May in which Manafort shot down a different attempt to have Trump meet with Putin or his representatives."Mr. Manafort's swift action reflects the attitude of the campaign -- any invitation by Russia, directly or indirectly, would be rejected outright," Maloni said in a written statement."His request that the response come from a low-level staffer sent a clear signal that the invitation did not merit consideration.This is concrete evidence the Russia collusion narrative is fake news."Campaign Rules Clovis, in a statement, said Papadopoulos was acting on his own and that the campaign had a strict rule against traveling abroad and claiming to speak on behalf of the campaign.Still, Clovis supervised Papadopolous and was questioned last week by Mueller's team and testified before a grand jury, NBC reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.Whether he corroborated Papadopolous's version of events is unknown.Embraced by the campaign with his connection to the important primary state of Iowa, Clovis is now working in the Department of Agriculture while awaiting approval by Congress to become the agency's chief scientist.NBC said his lawyer declined to comment on its inquiries about his testimony.Volunteer Adviser Papadopoulos was one of five volunteer advisers on foreign policy identified by Trump in a March 2016 interview.Over the next several months, according to court documents, he cultivated at least three contacts who promised "dirt" on Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, and introductions to top-level Russians.He kept some people in the campaign apprised of his efforts by email.The communications, by Skype, Facebook, text and email, show the electronic trail the government is following to verify how the campaign handled Russian contacts.One of those people, identified in court documents as Foreign Contact 2, is Ivan Timofeev, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Tuesday.He works for the Moscow-based Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-linked research group, and isn't a foreign ministry employee, despite Papadopoulos's assertion, she said.Timofeev declined to comment by email but posted on his group's site that he believed Papadopoulos was working on his own initiative."Apparently, he was an enthusiast with little experience," he said.In a private Facebook message to Timofeev during the Republican National Convention, Papadopoulos wrote, "Keep an eye on the speech tonight.Should be good."
Russian Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr. Seeks Return to US to Defend Money Laundering Case:::::Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, wants permission to return to the United States to defend a claim by prosecutors that her client's company has failed to pay a $6 million settlement in an international money laundering case.Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the U.S. government to settle a $230 million Russian tax fraud case related to Hermitage Capital, an American fund that invested in Russia.In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday U.S. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, but in a letter on Tuesday filed in federal court in Manhattan lawyers for Prevezon disagreed.About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon that the U.S. government had asked the Netherlands to freeze.The Netherlands lifted the hold on the money on October 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the Prevezon letter said.In Monday's court filing, U.S. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year while she was in the United States to represent Prevezon in the money laundering case.Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children" after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress after Hermitage Capital's Browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving Prevezon was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor for Hermitage Capital, who died in a Russian prison.Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year's election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would "incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."
Former Trump Adviser's Guilty Plea Could Rattle White House:::::President Donald Trump dismissed George Papadopoulos as a "liar" and a mere campaign volunteer, but newly unsealed court papers outline the former adviser's frequent contacts with senior officials and with foreign nationals who promised access to the highest levels of the Russian government.They also hint at more headaches for the White House and former campaign officials.Papadopoulos is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates possible coordination between Russia and Trump's 2016 White House campaign.Records made public Monday in Papadopoulos' case list a gaggle of people who were in touch with him during the campaign but only with such identifiers as "Campaign Supervisor," ''Senior Policy Advisor" and "High-Ranking Campaign Official."Two of the unnamed campaign officials referenced are in fact former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates.Both were charged with financial crimes in an indictment unsealed Monday.The conversations described in charging documents reflect Papadopoulos' efforts to arrange meetings between Trump aides and Russian government intermediaries and show how he learned the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails."Though the contacts may not by themselves have been illegal, the oblique but telling references to unnamed people including "Professor" and "Female Russian National" make clear that Mueller's team has identified multiple people who had knowledge of back-and-forth outreach efforts between Russians and associates of the Trump election effort.It's a reality that challenges the administration's portrait of Papadopoulos as a back-bench operator within the campaign, an argument repeated Tuesday by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who dismissed him as a "volunteer" with a minimal role.In charging the 30-year-old Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI, Mueller's team is warning of a similar fate for anyone whose statements deviate from the facts."I think everyone to whom Mueller and his team wanted to send a message heard loud and clear the message," said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer.The White House had braced over the weekend for an indictment of Manafort and for allegations of financial misconduct that it could dismiss as unrelated to the campaign or administration.Then came the unsealing of Papadopoulos' guilty plea and an accompanying statement of facts that detailed his efforts to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his cooperation with prosecutors since his arrest at an airport last summer.The extent of the contacts is substantial.During a six-month period ending Aug. 15, Papadopoulos met, telephoned, Skyped or emailed his three foreign contacts or five different Trump campaign officials a total of 29 times.He also traveled twice to London and once to Italy.Another trip to Moscow was canceled.There are clear indications prosecutors used Papadopoulos to gather more information about the campaign as they probe possible criminal activity.He was arrested in July, but the case was not unsealed until Monday, giving prosecutors weeks to debrief him for information and use him to get deeper into the campaign.He was initially arrested on false statements and obstruction of justice allegations, but as part of a plea deal, pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, a possible token of leniency in exchange for further cooperation.In court papers, prosecutors have said prematurely making the case public would hurt his ability to be a "proactive cooperator," which legal experts say could include surreptitious techniques like wearing a microphone to record conversations."I would infer from that that he was working proactively on behalf of the prosecutors, which would mean going out and obtaining evidence," said former Justice Department prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg.Though the campaign officials and other people referenced in the complaint are not named, it's nonetheless possible to ferret out the identities of several.For instance, Joseph Mifsud is the "London professor" who figures prominently in the case, according to a comparison of court papers and emails obtained by The Associated Press.Mifsud confirmed to The Telegraph newspaper that he is the professor mentioned as a would-be link between the Trump campaign and Russia.In court papers, Mifsud is described only as a "London professor" who met repeatedly with Papadopoulos and offered to set up meetings with Russian officials who could provide "thousands of emails" with damaging information about Clinton.The professor is also credited in the document with introducing Papadopoulos to a woman referred to as a "female Russian national" who served as a potential link to the Russian government.Papadopoulos described her incorrectly in emails to Trump campaign officials as Putin's niece.She has not yet been identified publicly.Mifsud, a vocal Putin backer, told the newspaper the FBI case lacks credibility and that he did not tell anyone he could produce emails that would weaken the Clinton campaign.Papadopoulos' place on the Trump campaign was formalized in March when Trump adviser Sam Clovis released the names of eight foreign policy advisers amid public pressure on Trump to disclose his foreign policy team.A lawyer representing Clovis confirmed in a statement that he was the person, identified as the "Campaign Supervisor" in court papers, who brought Papadopoulos onto an advisory committee on national security.In court papers, the unnamed supervisor receives some of Papadopoulos' email exchanges about his attempts to line up a meeting with the Russians, appearing to encourage the effort at one point by responding "Great work."He also later encouraged Papadopoulos to travel to Russia on his own.The lawyer's statement said Clovis opposed any trip to Russia for Trump or his campaign staff but noted that Clovis may not have made his opposition known when "a volunteer made suggestions on a foreign policy matter."The foreign policy advisory council on which Papadopoulos sat met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six times, according to an official involved with the group.Papadopoulos, who was based in London at the time, did not attend all of the meetings, but he did attend a dinner meeting of the advisers in late June at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Trump released a photo of the meeting on social media.Papadopoulos, who had no formal responsibilities, communicated most with Clovis and Manafort, according to an official involved with the group who was unauthorized to disclose internal campaign activities.Papadopoulos angered some on the foreign policy team in early May by urging former British Prime Minister David Cameron to apologize after calling Trump "divisive, stupid and wrong."
Trump's Chief of Staff Slowly Revealing Himself:::::In his three months on the job, John Kelly has been credited with bringing order to a chaotic West Wing, but don't call him a moderate.President Donald Trump's chief of staff was the enforcer of Trump's controversial immigration policies, has frequently criticized the president's enemies, and this week echoed his boss' defense of Confederate monuments.It all suggests that "The Chief," as he is known among aides, may have instilled order, but he is more ideologically aligned with Trump than many believed.Much has been made of the imagery of Kelly silently lurking on the sidelines of presidential addresses, seeming to cringe when Trump gets out of line.But it may be wishful thinking by Trump's critics to believe that he's tugging the president in another direction.White House officials and Kelly allies say he is not so much partisan as he is ideological, holding hawkish views on issues like immigration and national security.One ally, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said Kelly was undoubtedly conservative in mindset.The ally said Kelly's striking Oct. 19 press conference lamenting the nation's diminishing respect for women, religion and Gold Star families bared his true feelings.Kelly also has proven to be no stranger to controversy.His defense of Confederate monuments Monday in an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham eclipsed even earlier comments by Trump, as he praised Confederate commander Gen. Robert E. Lee."I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man," Kelly told Ingraham."He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now it's different today.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand."Congressional Black Caucus Chair Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., a frequent critic of the administration, said in a statement that Kelly "needs a history lesson" for ignoring slavery as the root cause of the conflict."He is starting to sound a lot like his boss," Richmond said.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Kelly's comments, citing a single historian's assessment of the war's roots."I'm not going to get up here and re-litigate the Civil War," Sanders said.And White House spokesman Raj Shah credits Kelly with ensuring Trump gets "the best counsel and can continue making the right decisions for the American people."Kelly's star rose in the Trump orbit earlier this year in part because of the worldview he shares with the president.A retired Marine general who led the U.S. Southern Command, Kelly moved swiftly to enforce and then defend the president's controversial travel ban, which remains tied up in litigation.And Trump credited Kelly, then the secretary of Homeland Security, for his tough talk on illegal immigration.In a speech in April, Kelly told lawmakers to "shut up and support the men and women on the front lines," and to change immigration laws if they don't agree with how they are being enforced.The previous month, he announced that his department was considering separating families crossing the border illegally in a bid to deter their migration.Trump took to marveling at statistics showing reduced crossings along the nation's southern border, and credited Kelly as his most effective Cabinet secretary, officials said.Kelly has also made clear he shares Trump's frustration with the media, mocking anonymously sourced stories of palace intrigue and what he perceives to be a negative tone in coverage.At the Coast Guard Academy commencement on May 17, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kelly joked that Trump ought to take a gifted ceremonial sword and "use it on the press."After Trump drew criticism for the tone of his call with the widow of a fallen service member, Kelly angrily attacked Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., who had described the president's conversation with the widow to reporters.He went on to deliver a factually inaccurate condemnation of a speech Wilson had given years earlier, accusing her of using the families of fallen law enforcement officers for political gain and referring to the congresswoman as an "empty barrel."Kelly told Ingraham he had nothing to apologize for: "For something like that, absolutely not.I stand by my comments."Since his arrival in the White House on July 31, Kelly has focused his efforts on tightening the flow of information to the president and reforming the administration's decision-making processes.But he has insisted that his role is not to manage Trump, but to manage those around him."I was not sent in to, or brought in to control him," Kelly told reporters on Oct. 12."And you should not measure my effectiveness as a chief of staff by what you think I should be doing."Kelly declined a request to be interviewed.
Trump Chooses Visit to Military Base Over DMZ:::::It has become something of a ritual for U.S. presidents trying to demonstrate their resolve against North Korea's ever-escalating aggression.Beginning with Dwight Eisenhower's visit to the front lines of wartime Korea, U.S. leaders have traveled to the barbed and mined demilitarized zone dividing the Korean Peninsula, peering across the barren north through binoculars, hearing broadcast propaganda, and reaffirming their commitment to standing with the South.After leaving the possibility of the visit dangling, the White House announced definitively Tuesday that President Donald Trump would not be following in their footsteps and will be forgoing a visit to the DMZ as he sets out on his maiden Asia trip.A senior administration official told reporters during a White House briefing that Trump will instead be visiting Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership and South Korea's burden-sharing.His tight schedule, officials said, wouldn't accommodate both stops.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details ahead of the trip, noted that several Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence, had already made the trip to the border that has separated the North and South for 64 years.Trump's trip comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric with North Korea, which has continued to pursue its missile and nuclear programs and ramped up its missile testing.In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would "totally destroy" the nation, if necessary.He has also derided North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as "little Rocket Man."Kim has returned the favor, calling Trump a "mentally deranged U.S.dotard."The White House has played down the notion that its hesitation to send Trump to the DMZ stemmed from security concerns.But two people familiar with the administration's thinking said that security issues had been discussed.The Secret Service, which advises on the president's itinerary, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its recommendations.U.S. and South Korean officials also argued that a visit to Camp Humphreys, also known as United States Army Garrison-Humphreys, at the invitation of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, serves as a fitting symbol of the countries' ties and South Korea's commitment to contributing to its own defense a theme the president often pressed during his campaign.Some experts on the region also breathed a sigh of relief, arguing the trip could have further inflamed tensions between Trump and Kim."I would probably be begging him not to (go).No Secret Service likes to," said Dean Cheng, a China expert with the Heritage Foundation.He said that, given the recent exchange of words between Kim and Trump, a visit was "probably more fraught with risk than your average presidential visit."Others pointed to the symbolism of the president's visit to the base."To me it was a no-brainer that he should go to Humphreys, this new base that they've poured all this money into," said Jim Schoff, a former Pentagon adviser on East Asia policy and now senior fellow in the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Schoff said the base was "perfect" for Trump: "It's a big, massive real estate project and it's South Korean-funded.It's the big story of the alliance in recent times and it's a great opportunity to highlight that," he said.Troy Stangarone, a senior director at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington, agreed that, with the move of United States Forces Korea to Camp Humphreys almost complete, "a visit there sends a stronger signal about U.S. commitment to defend South Korea."A trip to the DMZ , he said, "could instead be misinterpreted and raise tensions on the Korean peninsula."Visiting the wooded, craggy terrain inside the DMZ is like going back in time to 1953.In July of that year, the Korean War armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, the so-called "truce village" bisected by a marker that is the official dividing line between North and South Korea.This is the only area inside the DMZ where soldiers of North and South can stand nose to nose.In 1983, Ronald Reagan became first U.S. president to enter the DMZ with South Korean artillery gunners standing poised to fire if necessary to protect him and every president, barring one, has made the trip since.Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, visited during a 2012 trip to Seoul and told troops stationed at the border that "the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity."In 1993, Bill Clinton stood closer to North Korean territory than any Western leader, walking out on the "Bridge of No Return" and looking through binoculars at North Koreans about 50 yards away.He later recalled seeing young North Korean soldiers looking back at him and thinking: "I wish you could walk over this bridge and I hope it won't be long until you can, until we put down the threat of nuclear war and open up the hand of friendship."Pence said his visit earlier this year let North Koreans "see our resolve in my face."But Evans Revere, a former senior State Department official for East Asia, said that he was disappointed by Trump's decision.He said a visit would have helped the president understand the human toll of any potential military action and see for himself just how close Seoul is to the border."By not visiting the DMZ, President Trump can only remind our allies, once again, that he does not view our alliance commitments in the same way as did every one of his predecessors," he said.
Manafort, Gates Pose 'Serious Risk of Flight,' Says Mueller:::::Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, the two former high-ranking campaign aides to then-candidate Donald Trump, pose a "serious risk of flight" considering their massive wealth, overseas connections, and the possible prison time facing them, special counsel Robert Mueller writes in just-filed court papers.Indictments against the two men were announced Monday by Mueller's office.They face money-laundering and other charges unrelated to the campaign."The defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections," Mueller wrote in a bail memo unsealed Tuesday and reported by NBC News."Both have had substantial overseas ties, including assets held abroad, significant foreign work connections, and significant travel abroad.Those aspects of the defendants' history and characteristics evidence a risk of flight."The memo notes Manafort registered a phone and email account in March using an alias and took the phone on a trip to Mexico in June and to China and Ecuador in May.Manafort also has traveled to Dubai, Cancun, Panama City, Havana, Shanghai, Madrid, Tokyo, and Grand Cayman Island in the past year, according to the filing.He and Gates both traveled to Cypress, where many of their foreign accounts are based.
Democrat Lagging With Minorities in Va. Governor's Race:::::Democratic Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam has a slight lead in next Tuesday's Virginia governor's race, but a recent private poll shows him performing more poorly with minorities than expected, The Washington Post reports.The Northam campaign reportedly asked the pro-immigration group America's Voice not to release its findings.Northam spokesman David Turner told the post he generally does not like to see polls released that will give the opponent free data.Turner also said minority voter support typically rises closer to the election and the campaign's internal polling shows Northam even with or surpassing Democratic Gov.Terry McAuliffe's support with black and Latino voters in 2013.The news comes a day after a controversial ad aimed at luring minority voters hit the Internet.The ad, produced by the left-leaning Latino Victory Fund, shows a supposed supporter of Republican Ed Gillespie driving around a neighborhood in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag waving from the bed.The man chases two Hispanic children, as well as a black child and a young Muslim girl in a headscarf.Gillespie and other Republicans slammed the ad, but Northam defended it, saying the voices of those who feel threatened by Gillespie and his support of President Donald Trump need to be heard.The group pulled the ad and the tweet promoting it on Tuesday following the deadly terrorist in New York in which a rented truck was used to mow down pedestrians and bicyclists.At least eight were killed.
Sen Scott Rebukes Gen Kelly: 'No Compromise to Make' on Slavery:::::The Senate's sole black Republican on Tuesday rebuked chief of staff John Kelly's claim the Civil War was caused by the inability to compromise, saying "there was no compromise to make," only a choice to continue or end slavery.In a statement, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. who has been outspoken about racism and met with President Donald Trump after a violent white supremacist rally in Virginia said it was time to stop "relitigating and referencing the Civil War as if there was some moral conundrum," HuffPost reported."There was no compromise to make only a choice between continuing slavery and ending it," he said, according to the HuffPost."We need to move forward together, instead of letting the divisions of the past continue to force us apart."Kelly on Monday said a "lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War," triggering the ire of historians, including Stephanie McCurry, a history professor at Columbia University, who told The Washington Post that Kelly's comments echoed talking points of a "pro-Confederate view of the Civil War."
Trump's Opioid Commission to Ask for Programs, Not Money:::::President Donald Trump's opioid commission is expected to call for big boosts in substance abuse treatment programs Wednesday but will not ask for new funding to pay for them, Politico reported.Led by New Jersey GOP Gov.Chris Christie, the panel will recommend the Trump administration boost access to addiction treatment and recovery programs, expand the availability of medication-assisted therapies, including expanding the ability of first responders to give the overdose reversal drug, naloxone, Politico reported, citing a draft of the final report it obtained.The panel acknowledges a lack of funding hampers implementation, but does not lay out a figure, project how long money will be needed, or where it should come from, Politico reported.Among its other recommendations, the panel calls for: An increase the number of doctors trained in addiction medicine, to fund research on new pain, overdose reversal and addiction treatments.Help for states to to share data from their prescription drug monitoring programs.A national media campaign.The restoration of funding for surveys of chronic drug users and morbidity information including the Drug Abuse Warning Network that tracked drug mentions in hospital emergency rooms but ended in 2011."It's great to have good ideas, but you need money to implement them," Chuck Ingoglia, vice president of public policy at the National Council for Behavioral Health, told Politico."How do any of these things get paid for?""Regarding the commission thank you for reaffirming what we already knew," he added.Andrew Kessler, who runs a Washington, D.C., consulting firm specializing in behavioral health, told Politico it is up to Congress to take the ideas and come up with appropriate funding.
Hope Hicks Scheduled to Speak With Mueller Team:::::President Donald Trump's communications director, Hope Hicks, is set to speak with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation team in mid-November, Politico reported.The longtime Trump aide, who previously worked for the Trump Organization and is considered part of the president's inner circle, will talk to the investigators after Trump's trip to Asia."Nothing about recent events alters the White House's commitment to fully cooperate with the office of the special counsel," White House lawyer Ty Cobb told Politico on Tuesday.Hicks hired the law firm of Robert Trout of the Trout Cacheris & Janis in August to represent her as investigations into Russian election meddling continue.According to Politico, the continued cooperation of the White House with the investigation despite pressure from some Trump supporters to either defund the Mueller probe or shake up the White House legal team in favor of a more combative approach is a signal the White House is confident Trump's in no real jeopardy.On Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president still supported his current legal team."I'm not sure how he couldn't, considering ...all of the revelations that have taken place ...have nothing to do with the president, have nothing to do with his campaign," she said, Politico reported.
Texas GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling Announces Retirement:::::Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling announced Tuesday that he will retire and not seek re-election next year, The Dallas Morning News reported."Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned," Hensarling wrote to supporters.The congressman, first elected in 2003, is the chairman of House Financial Services Committee.Hensarling recently raised eyebrows in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, telling people who live in flood-prone areas that "God's telling you to move."
Trump blames Schumer, Democrats for immigration policies he says led to terror attack:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, less than 24 hours after a 29-year-old Uzbek national allegedly drove a truck down a bike path and killed at least eight people, blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats for immigration policies he claims allowed the suspect to enter the United States.In a series of tweets on Wednesday morning, Trump turned his focus from comforting those impacted in New York and focused on advocating for the tougher immigration laws that defined his 2016 campaign."The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty," Trump tweeted."I want merit based."Minutes later, he added: "We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter)."Trump's initial Twitter response to the attack labeled the attacker a "very sick and deranged person" and offered his "thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack."Trump later tweeted that he was ordering his Department of Homeland Security to "step up our already Extreme Vetting Program."It was not clear what program the President was referring to.Reached Tuesday night, DHS referred all questions on the "vetting" order to the White House, which did not respond to questions.Soon after Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, Schumer responded with a tweet of his own: "I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy."Schumer also accused the President of "politicizing and dividing America" and urged him to focus "on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget."Trump's decision to address immigration policy hours after the terrorist attack is markedly different than the tact the White House took after a shooter in Las Vegas opened fire on a concert last month, killing 58.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, asked about gun control policy the day after the shooting in Las Vegas, dismissed the idea of talking about policy so soon after a shooting."We haven't had the moment to have a deep dive on the policy part of that," Sanders said."We've been focused on the fact that we had a severe tragedy in our country.And this is a day of mourning, a time of bringing our country together, and that's been the focus of the administration this morning."Pressed on why Trump brought up the travel ban hours after shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino, Sanders added at the time, "I think there's a difference between being a candidate and being the President."JUST WATCHED Bill de Blasio: Trump, don't politicize tragedy Replay More Videos ...

Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been an ardent critic of Trump, noted in a tweet Wednesday that the Gang of Eight bill, had it been signed into law, would have done away with the diversity visa program.The Cotton-Perdue bill would roughly halve the number of green cards overall per year, a point of contention for many Democrats and Republicans alike, and wouldn't easily allow for low skilled immigrants to come to the US permanently, another sticking point for many.JUST WATCHED Flake slams Trump's tweets, defends Schumer Replay More Videos ...

Adam Schiff, D-California, told MSNBC."No matter where an attack happens around the world, whether it's in the United States, Europe, he immediately goes to questions about immigration."
Trump didn't dismiss idea when adviser suggested setting up Putin meeting:::::Washington (CNN) Candidate Donald Trump did not dismiss the idea of arranging a meeting with Russia's president when it was suggested in a meeting with his campaign foreign policy advisers last year, according to a person in the room.The idea was raised by George Papadopoulos as he introduced himself at a March 2016 meeting of the Republican candidate's foreign policy advisers, according to a court filing."He didn't say yes and he didn't say no," the official said, declining to be more specific about Trump's response to Papadopoulos.But the chairman of Trump's national security team, then Alabama senator and now attorney general Jeff Sessions, shut down the idea of a Putin meeting at the March 31, 2016, gathering, according to the source.His reaction was confirmed with another source who had discussed Session's role.Trump's response to Papadopoulos' offer could be of interest to special counsel's office.Read More
Three options for Republicans plotting a Trump counterattack:::::(CNN) The political community's dominant reaction to high-level Republicans like Sen. Jeff Flake and former President George W. Bush denouncing President Donald Trump has been that the attacks only underscore their weakness and the strength of his hold on the party.That may be true in the near-term.But history sends a very different message.Almost always when a significant faction within a political party has felt suppressed or marginalized, eventually they have found a way to kick back -- typically leaving a dent on their party's fortunes in the process.The mechanisms of that resistance have varied, from building cross-party alliances in Congress to mounting an independent presidential campaign or even starting a new party."Usually when there are people who are dissatisfied with what's going on in their party they find ways to hurt the party, either by organizing factions within the party or starting a new party," says Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University historian.Trump's defenders correctly note that polls show a preponderant majority of Republicans approve of his job performance.But, from the 19th century anti-slavery Northern Whigs like Abraham Lincoln, to the 20th century segregationist Southern Democrats like Strom Thurmond, dissidents historically haven't needed to command a majority of their party to have an impact.All that's been required is that they represent a component of the coalition large enough to cause damage if they defect, either in legislative fights or elections.The test through history has been that dissidents typically must be willing to accept short-term harm to their party as the price for advancing a direction they believe will strengthen it over the long-term."The only way to take your party back," says Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz "is to run against it."Trump arguably benefited from this very phenomenon in 2016 when he swept to victory and reshaped the party behind commanding support from its blue-collar wing.But now he is, in record time, in the reverse position, particularly among leaders from the party's more white-collar, or business establishment, wing.In recent weeks, a procession of Republican Party leaders has offered the case for such an insurrection.They have accused Trump of fomenting racial division at home; abandoning America's values abroad; lacking the stability and competence to effectively serve as commander in chief; or all of the above.The list of GOP leaders embracing some version of that critique include the party's past three presidential nominees (Mitt Romney, John McCain and Bush); several senators (Flake, McCain, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ben Sasse of Nebraska); Ohio Gov.John Kasich; and a wide array of GOP thinkers and writers.JUST WATCHED Flake: More Republicans will be speaking out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Flake: More Republicans will be speaking out 01:21 Pete Wehner, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center and a leading GOP critic of Trump, acknowledges the dissidents have not yet determined the best way to challenge Trump's direction."I don't know what will work," says Wehner, formerly the director for strategic initiatives in the George W Bush White House."You need different figures to make different cases to see what resonates.You need institutions that can make the counter case.You need writers and voters of authority to do it.I think you just need everything to begin to do it.There's an opening but it's not clear what emerges from that opening."While it's uncertain what forms of internal resistance might prove most effective for Trump's GOP critics, experience provides no shortage of alternatives.Since the mid-19th century, party dissidents have employed a wide array of weapons to make their discontent known.Ranging from the least to the most disruptive, they include: Organizing a new faction: The most straightforward way for party leaders to promote a new direction is to coalesce into an organization that agitates for it.Two recent examples demonstrate the potential of this approach.Though the Conservative Opportunity Society led by young Republican House members began as a clear minority when Newt Gingrich launched it after 1980, within a decade it had won most of the GOP caucus to its vision of a more confrontational and ideologically purist party.Formed a few years later, the Democratic Leadership Council also, for a time, steered the Democratic Party toward a more centrist vision symbolized by the election of Bill Clinton, one of its leaders, to the presidency.Building a cross-party legislative alliance Woodrow Wilson the 28th President of the United States of America in 1916.House and Senate members have sometimes resisted their party's direction by systematically allying with legislators from the other party.Legislators from both parties sympathetic to the progressive movement aligned against more conservative voices on each side to help Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, and Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, pass their agendas from 1901 to 1920.Conservative Southern Democrats bonded with Midwestern Republicans to create the so-called Conservative Coalition that usually stymied liberals in Congress (and often the White House) from 1938 through 1964.Mounting an Independent presidential candidacy President Theodore Roosevelt, shown in 1912.An even more emphatic expression of discontent has come when a marginalized faction bolts their party to support their own presidential candidate.Progressives did that by rallying behind the independent candidacies of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 (whose insurgency against William Howard Taft, his more conservative successor, helped tip the election to Wilson) and Robert M. La Follette in 1924 (which had less effect.)Similarly, anti-integration Southern Democrats backed the independent candidacies of Thurmond in 1948 (which didn't prevent Democrat Harry Truman from winning) and George Wallace in 1968 (which did help defeat Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey).Starting a new party The nuclear option for party dissidents has been to form a full-scale new party.That happened around 1890 when, as Kazin notes, Southern Democrats and Western Republicans founded the People's Party (better known as the Populists) after both major parties resisted greater oversight of the new corporate behemoths rapidly reshaping the economy.After initially electing dozens of governors, senators and congressmen, the Populists peaked and faded quickly.But they lastingly converted the Democrats to their agenda of government as a counterweight to business power after William Jennings Bryan, a leader in their cause, captured the Democratic presidential nomination in 1896.An even more successful example came in the 1850s.As that decade opened, both of the era's major parties, the Whigs and Democrats, failed to oppose slavery for fear of alienating their Southern factions.That disenfranchised the many Northern voters hostile to slavery.But after the passage of the inflammatory Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which potentially opened all new territories to slavery, anti-slavery leaders in both parties defected to form the Republican Party.The Republican Party offered Northern voters what neither existing party would: an alternative that was clearly opposed to slavery's expansion.And behind that message it elected Lincoln as president in 1860, just four years after it ran its first presidential candidate in 1856.Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States of America.Trump's current-day Republican critics probably don't have a Lincoln warming up in the bullpen.And they are highly unlikely to start a new party.But the Republican Party's emergence in the 1850s underscores the powerful truth that when a significant constituency of voters believe neither party is representing their views, they will demand an alternative that does.Is there such a disaffected audience inside the GOP coalition?Though Trump's overall approval rating among Republicans remains high, polls also suggest that elements of his agenda and especially his style, are straining the party's hold on the voters who most resemble critics like Flake, Sasse, Kasich, and Romney: college-educated whites in professional or management positions.Many of those voters share Trump's support for the traditional Republican goals of less federal taxes, spending and regulation, which complicates the picture.But in recent Pew Research Center polling, college-educated Republicans were less likely than their counterparts without degrees to say they approved of Trump's personal behavior as president or to endorse his skepticism of immigration and global trade.Other polls have shown white-collar unease with his approach to racial issues.Trump's overall approval rating among all college-educated whites has remained mired for months in the mid-30s, well below the usual level for a GOP president.And in one recent University of New Hampshire poll, fewer than 40% of likely GOP primary voters with a four-year college degree or more said they were inclined to vote for Trump again.It's easy to imagine a Trump critic targeting those well-educated voters as the foundation of a GOP primary challenge to him or an independent third-party candidacy in 2020.Today it appears either such effort would face long odds of success (although the progress of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation could alter that calculus).But, like earlier rebellions, if such an uprising merely wounded Trump it could allow his critics to warn their party that it cannot succeed without them.And, if that message is ignored, history suggests such a challenge could accelerate the long-term migration away from the GOP of the voters sympathetic to it.In exactly that way, Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 insurgency prefigured Franklin Roosevelt's later consolidation of progressive voters into his durable New Deal coalition and Wallace's 1968 revolt foreshadowed the later shift of conservative Southern whites into the GOP under Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.The hard price is that any of these alternatives -- from voting with the other party to launching a primary challenge-- ensures the dissidents will be loudly accused of helping the other party.Wehner says that's a risk Trump's critics must accept."In normal times that would be a persuasive argument, but it's not normal times," Wehner says."Donald Trump is doing more damage to the Republican Party and traditional conservatism than Hillary Clinton ever could.That doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to help Democrats.But if you are going to oppose him you have to do that."Trump's Republican critics face many financial, logistical and political obstacles to building a viable alternative.But Abraham Lincoln, during his reluctant transition from Whig to Republican over slavery, might have agreed with every word Wehner said.
US Navy: Two deadly collisions this summer were 'avoidable':::::(CNN) The US Navy has released a report concluding that two fatal collisions that resulted in the deaths of 17 sailors this summer were "avoidable."The USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collided with commercial ships in June and August, respectively.Regarding the Fitzgerald, the Navy said many of the decisions made leading to the collision were the result of poor judgment and decision making by the commanding officer of the ship.According to the Navy's findings, no single person bears full responsibility for the incident.The crew was unprepared for the situation in which they found themselves and hampered by ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation.The Navy has determined that "numerous failures occurred on the part of leadership and watchstanders" aboard the USS Fitzgerald.The Navy cites the following failures in the USS Fitzgerald collision: Read More
Bump stock ban goes nowhere a month after Las Vegas:::::Washington (CNN) Many lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, agreed one response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history should be to ban the sale of bump stocks -- but a month later, they are still legal and neither Congress nor the agency in charge of controlling such devices appear to be taking steps to outlaw them.A bump fire stock, also known as a bump stock, is a device that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly, similar to automatic weapons.Twelve of them were found on firearms recovered from the gunman's Las Vegas hotel room.Gun control legislation has failed to make any progress in Congress after each mass shooting, and the Las Vegas massacre appears to be no different.After the massacre, lawmakers first responded by saying they, including House Speaker Paul Ryan , didn't even know what a bump stock was.Ryan then called for a regulatory fix for bump fire stocks earlier, rather than passing legislation that was proposed in the House and Senate."We think the regulatory fix is the smartest, quickest fix," he said when asked about how to address the devices.Also in response at the time, nine Republican senators sent a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives asking the agency to review its policy on bump fire stock."We recognize that it is impossible to prevent tragedy and acts of 'pure evil,' in the words of our President," the senators wrote."We believe, however, the tragic events in Las Vegas brought to light an issue from this past administration that we respectfully request that your Bureau swiftly review," After the shooting, the National Rifle Association pointed to the ATF to regulate the device."The ATF should review bump-fire stocks to ensure they comply with federal law," Jennifer Baker, spokeswoman for the Institute for Legislative Action at the NRA, told CNN, calling bills to ban them "intentionally overreaching."But so far, there's been no change in the regulation of the device.A spokeswoman for the ATF told CNN on Tuesday that Senate judiciary committee staffers were briefed by the ATF regarding bump stock related matters, but had nothing further to add.When asked about the status of bump stock regulation on Tuesday, GOP Sen. John Thune's office referred to the letter, which he was part of sending -- but there appeared to be no new developments.Stalled legislation In the House, Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, introduced legislation to ban the sale of bump stocks, but there's been no action since.And in the Senate, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill that would ban the sale, transfer, importation, manufacture or possession of bump stocks, as well as trigger cranks and other accessories that accelerate a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire.GOP Sen. Ron Johnson was outspoken after the shooting about his support for banning bump stocks following the shooting.Asked for comment about the lack of action, his office only referred back to a statement he gave Politico for story published on October 4."Automatic weapons are illegal," he said at the time."If that (bump stocks) facilitates that, to me it would be subject to the same ban.If that (bill banning bump stocks) actually gets on the Senate floor, I'd vote for it."On Tuesday, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who has been engaged in the gun debate on Capitol Hill for years, told CNN that he's heard nothing on whether ATF is seriously looking at changing regulations surrounding bump stocks."I don't think the ATF is going to move unless the White House tells them to move and my impression is that they have been given no direction from the White House," Murphy said."It is unclear what the ATF can do," Murphy added.GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham also told CNN he hadn't heard anything about where ATF is in reviewing bump stocks."I think once they make a decision then it would be our job to evaluate if it makes sense or not," Graham said.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN that he thinks that the idea of a regulatory change is not enough, adding also he has not heard anything from the ATF on what they are doing now."We need legislation because the alternative is 'regulation,' which means two or three years of waiting for a rule that the NRA itself probably will challenge and tie it up for years more," he told CNN."So I think the proposal for a rule or regulation is a deceptive dodge, purposefully suggested by the NRA as a way to avoid any real prohibition."GOP Sen. John Barrasso told CNN that he hasn't heard what the ATF is doing about bump stocks now."I'm expecting to hear from them.I don't know that they're timeline is going to be, but It was something most of us hadn't heard of beforehand and then we found out how it came to be, we found out it was the ATF and we expect them to deal with it and let us know," Barrasso said.
The 24 most amazing John Boehner quotes in one amazing John Boehner story:::::Washington (CNN) John Boehner has stopped being polite -- and started getting real.In a series of interviews with Politico's Tim Alberta for a massive -- and massively entertaining -- profile of the former speaker of the House , Boehner offered his thoughts on everything from Jason Chaffetz and Jim Jordan (Does.Not.Like.)to what members of Congress should eat, to Ted Cruz (see Chaffetz and Jordan) to, yes, his smoking habits.The whole story is amazing, but what stands out is Boehner's candor.Time and time again, he tells Alberta what he really thinks about his former colleagues -- a sort of frankness that has almost entirely disappeared in politics.(Former Vice President Joe Biden, who speaks highly of Boehner to Alberta, is, like Boehner, one of the remaining practitioners of this kind of politics.)Below are the 24 most remarkable quotes from Boehner in the story.In some of them I've added a thought or two.Others are, um, self explanatory.1."I've never had a hot dog for dinner in my life."So many questions.Does this mean Boehner has never eaten a hot dog before?Or that he just hasn't eaten one for dinner?Has he eaten a hot dog for breakfast?Lunch?Brunch?2."If I was going to die from smoking cigarettes, I'd already be dead."Boehner smokes two packs of cigarettes a day.He is 67 years old.3."F*** Jordan.F*** Chaffetz.They're both assholes."That's Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah that Boehner is referring to.Jordan -- one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, an influential bloc of conservatives -- is someone with whom Boehner repeatedly clashed in his time as speaker.Chaffetz, who left Congress earlier this year for a job at Fox News, is talented but selfish, according to Boehner -- a "total phony."4."A terrorist.A legislative terrorist."Boehner is referring to Jordan here -- but his critique can easily be broadened to represent the sort of compromise-equals-capitulation crowd that helped push him out of office.5."You're gonna be a fat-ass."That's Boehner's advice to Rep. Patrick McHenry when the then-speaker saw the North Carolina Republican eating an ice cream sandwich.6."DeLay and I were never close.Matter of fact, half the stab wounds in my back are from him."Tom DeLay, who spent years as House majority whip, is not likely to be on the Boehner Christmas card list.7."They're never going to see an ounce of disappointment on my face.We're just going to earn our way back."Boehner on his attitude after being ousted as House GOP conference chairman in the wake of the 1998 election.Also, a window into how Boehner handled his speakership amid historically large challenges presented by members of his own party.8."F*** you."Boehner's response to Alaska GOP Rep. Don Young after Boehner says Young held a 10-inch knife to his throat in a dispute over earmarking.9."He had more gay staff than anybody I knew -- at a time when it was a bit unusual."That's Boehner's take on the revelations that Dennis Hastert, the man under whom he served as speaker, had molested a number of young men during his days as a high school wrestling coach.That is a very odd quote.10."Heritage was a respected conservative think tank, and he turned it into some half-assed political operation."11."It's hard to negotiate with no dick."Um.OK. 12."But that little son of a bitch got under my skin."Boehner on Harry Reid.Also, Reid and Boehner became "really good friends" after Boehner confronted him before a White House meeting.13."The President, the vice president, Reid, Pelosi, they're all sitting there with the biggest s***-eating grins on their faces that you've ever seen, because they can't believe we're this f***ing stupid.'"Boehner was not a big fan of the 2013 government shutdown.He eventually went along with it.But he was right that the government shutdown would be blamed on Republicans.14."He's the most miserable son of a bitch I've ever had to work with."Boehner on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whom he blames for forcing the government shutdown to benefit his own political future.15."That was the worst campaign ever run."This is a reference to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's unsuccessful primary campaign against Dave Brat in 2014 .Cantor's loss was an absolutely stunning defeat that signaled the continued power of the tea party.According to Boehner, the Cantor loss was the end of the end for his chances of holding onto the speakership.16."He's an idiot.I can't tell you what makes him tick."Boehner is still angry at North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus member, for trying to force a vote on vacating the speakership.The vote never came to pass, but it was the catalyst of forcing Boehner to decide to resign.17."I looked at that statue of the Virgin Mary next to St. Peter's Church, and I decided, all right, today's the day."Boehner's description of the day he decided to resign is pure Boehner.18."So 43 says, 'Hey, are you talking to Ryan?Are you giving him advice?'I said, 'Yeah, if he calls, I give him advice.'And he texts me back: 'He needs to call you more.'"Boehner is recounting -- to a reporter -- a text exchange with former President George W. Bush about Speaker Paul Ryan.And it's a text that doesn't paint Ryan in a good light.Amazing.19."You're a p****."Boehner is telling a story about how the 43rd President wouldn't join Burning Tree -- a male-only golf club in Maryland -- because of the optics of a president doing so.This is how Boehner viewed Bush's decision.20."Donald Trump's not a Republican.He's not a Democrat.He's a populist.He doesn't have an ideological bone in his body."This is 100% right.21."They'll be talking about the end of the two-party system."Boehner's prediction of how his speakership will be remembered is ominous.22."What a s***show."Boehner on the current state of politics.23."I called him and said, 'Listen, you're nuts.'"This conversation between Boehner and conservative mouthpiece Sean Hannity must have been a doozy.24."But you can't force the big guy to give you an answer."Boehner responding to a question about whether he has found a purpose in life.The answer is "no."But he is still waiting for a sign.
The most important race of 2017 is getting very close:::::Washington (CNN) If you're looking for one race this fall to tell you what people make of the first year of the Trump presidency, your best bet is the Virginia governor's race where next week, voters will choose between Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie.The race has long looked like Northam's to lose.He's better known than Gillespie (Northam is the sitting lieutenant governor) and Virginia has been moving to the left, rapidly, over the last few elections; Hillary Clinton won it in 2016 and Barack Obama won it in 2008 and 2012.But a new Washington Post poll shows Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, closing a 13-point gap earlier this month to just 5 points with seven days of campaigning left.Gillespie has tightened the race despite the fact that President Donald Trump's popularity is in the tank in Virginia, with almost six in 10 Virginians (59%) disapproving of the way Trump is handling the presidency.A majority of voters -- 57% -- say that Trump is an "important" factor in their votes, with 38% saying the President is a "very" important factor in deciding their vote.Read More
Republicans grapple with tax reform as bill release is delayed:::::(CNN) It was supposed to be the day the House Republicans finally unveiled their long-anticipated bill to overhaul the tax code.Instead, it marked the first setback."Ways and means committee members met tonight to discuss the work we are doing on pro-growth tax reform.In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday," Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced in a statement."We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week."Sources on Capitol Hill and at the White House told CNN Tuesday evening that the GOP bill's release would be delayed until Thursday, but adding to the confusion, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady emerged after a three-hour meeting with his committee members to say that there were no scheduling changes to announce just minutes before he finally announced the bill had been delayed."We are making excellent progress," the Texas Republican said at the time."We are very close to what we set out to do, bold, pro-growth tax reform.A lot (of) work remains with the drafters right now.They will continue to work through the night.We're moving forward.No announcement of change in the schedule."After months of fractious negotiations, House Republicans appear to be struggling to deliver on their first of many ambitious deadlines on tax reform.The party was supposed to be ready Wednesday with a tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate to 20%, reduced the number of individual rates from seven to four, boosted the child tax credit, eradicated many deductions and closed loopholes, something that hadn't been done in decades.But the leaders had encountered clear obstacles from some of their own members."Property tax was a step in the right direction, but it's not enough," said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican.In recent days, members of the House ways and means committee huddled around the clock to put the finishing touches on the bill with many admitting that they were still working through issues -- including how to offset tax cuts -- in the final hours."There are a few hang ups left," Rep. Pat Tiberi, a Republican from Ohio, told reporters Tuesday afternoon.Conservatives from outside groups met with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday and said they left feeling there was still work to do even though they were optimistic about the direction of the bill."I left the meeting with the impression that that bill is not done," Adam Brandon, the President of FreedomWorks, told CNN."They have to hammer out the final deal with some of these Northeastern Republicans on that SALT deduction."Down Pennsylvania Avenue, one White House aide told CNN that the White House wasn't concerned about the delay.The aide told CNN it would give House members more time to discuss the language and resolve any outstanding differences.And Trump himself appeared to be highlighting the work congressional Republicans were doing late into Halloween evening."The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve.These will be biggest ever!"Trump tweeted.
5 changes for Obamacare open enrollment for 2018:::::Open enrollment for Obamacare 2018 starts Wednesday.Some things will stay the same.Consumers can still sign up on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, or their state marketplaces.They can still get subsidies to help lower their premiums or reduce their deductibles and co-pays, if they qualify.And, they can still shop and compare coverage options, which is especially important this time around.But there's a whole lot that will be different under the Trump administration, which has vowed to dismantle the health reform law.Some plans will be much more expensive, while others a lot less so.There will be less enrollment help available from some non-profit groups, but it may be easier to get advice from brokers.And the sign-up period will be a lot shorter.These changes -- combined with President Trump's repeated declarations that Obamacare is dead -- could mean a lot fewer people will enroll for 2018.Some experts estimate that sign ups could fall by 1 or 2 million from the 12.2 million who initially picked plans this year.Only 40% of current Obamacare enrollees and 15% of the uninsured know that enrollment begins on Wednesday, according to the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll.Here are five changes coming to Obamacare open enrollment for 2018: Silver plans are pricier.Premiums for the benchmark silver Obamacare plan will soar 37%, on average, in 2018, according to federal data.But how much consumers will pay depends a lot on where they live.In Alaska, for instance, the price of the benchmark silver plan will drop by 22%, on average, because the state created a reinsurance plan that protects carriers from footing the entire bill for enrollees with high medical bills.But in Iowa, where only one insurer will remain on the exchange, premiums for the benchmark plan are skyrocketing 88%.Related: Premiums for popular Obamacare plans to soar 37% for 2018 It will also depend on which policy they pick.The lowest cost silver plan, for instance, is only rising 17% in price, on average, according to federal data.Many insurers jacked up the rates of their silver plans in part to make up for President Trump ending federal support for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies.These subsidies reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees.Most consumers, however, will be shielded from the rate hikes.That's because they get premium subsidies that limit their monthly cost to less than 10% of their household income.Gold policies are more affordable for some.Premium subsidies are also soaring since they are pegged to the price of the benchmark silver plan.But the average premium for the lowest cost gold plan is rising only 19%.That means the cheapest gold policy will have lower rates than the least expensive silver plan in 459 counties next year once subsidies are factored in, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.The gold plans may be much more attractive to enrollees since they come with an average deductible of $1,320, compared to just over $4,000 for a silver policy, according to Health Pocket, an online health insurance shopping tool.Related: Trump's quest to kill Obamacare hurts the middle class Other policies may also be more affordable next year.Some 80% of enrollees will be able to find a plan for $75 a month or less -- up from 71% this year and the highest share so far.Many more consumers will be able to obtain coverage without paying anything.For instance, a 48-year-old consumer earning roughly $30,000 can find a zero-premium bronze policy in nearly 1,050 counties next year, up from 132 counties in 2017, according to an analysis by Oliver Wyman consulting group.There's a new expanded bronze plan.Earlier this year, the Trump administration authorized insurers to sell bronze plans that pick up less of enrollees' health care costs, on average.These "expanded bronze" policies should have lower premiums, but higher out-of-pocket costs.Also, consumers will have the option to buy a bronze high-deductible plan with a health savings account in the states on the federal exchange.Enrollees can skip healthcare.gov.Consumers will now be able to enroll directly through certain third-party websites, rather than having to go to the federal exchange's site to complete their applications.Also, healthcare.gov will make it easier for consumers to connect with agents and brokers for assistance with applications through a new "Help on Demand" service.Related: Trump administration is making it even harder to sign up for Obamacare The Trump administration says this will provide Americans with more ways to enroll.Critics, however, worry that applicants may be steered to certain insurers' products and may not be told of less-expensive options.The enrollment period is shorter.Perhaps the biggest change is that consumers will have only half the time to sign up for 2018 coverage.Open enrollment on the federal exchange runs only through Dec. 15, instead of through the end of January, as in some prior years.Some states that run their own exchanges, however, are extending the sign-up period.California and New York residents, for instance, will be able to enroll through Jan. 31, while Washington consumers will have until Jan. 15.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year The shorter enrollment period makes it particularly important for current consumers to shop and compare the plans available to them.That's because those who don't actively select a plan by Dec. 15 will be automatically re-enrolled in their current plan, or a similar one if it's been discontinued.However, unlike in prior years, participants in many states won't be able to switch to another policy after that date since the enrollment period will be over.This is a big deal because some policies will be far costlier next year.Consumers may get stuck if they don't shop around.Most consumers aren't aware of the shorter enrollment period.Only 25% of enrollees and 5% of the uninsured knew when it ends, the Kaiser poll found.
Fact check: Team Trump uses inaccuracies in wake of Mueller:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his stable of surrogates have tried to discredit former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in wake of his guilty plea to special counsel Robert Muelle r, casting him as nothing more than a low-level "coffee boy" who rarely -- if ever -- interacted with senior members of Trump's campaign.Those comments, though, belie Papadopoulos' actual role in the campaign, as laid out by Mueller's statement of charges , and use misinformation and inaccuracies to deride the former campaign adviser.On Monday, it was revealed Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with foreign officials with Russian government connections.It was also revealed Papadopoulos was a "proactive cooperator" in the Russia probe, meaning he had been working with Mueller and his team after they caught him lying to the FBI.The news came on the same day former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates were arrested.'Coffee boy' JUST WATCHED Caputo: Papadopoulos was a coffee boy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Caputo: Papadopoulos was a coffee boy 01:01 Claim Former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told CNN on Tuesday that Papadopoulos was nothing more than a "coffee boy" on the 2016 campaign who "never showed up at Trump Tower.""He ... never had any interaction with any of the campaign leaders around me, and the leaders of the Washington office of the campaign didn't even know who he was until his name appeared in the press," Caputo told CNN's "New Day."Reality Though Papadopoulos may have not been omnipresent at Trump's campaign headquarters, describing him as a "coffee boy" ignores the fact that he attended a roundtable meeting with Trump in March 2016 and then-candidate Trump described him as an "excellent guy" in an interview with The Washington Post.Papadopoulous was also emailing with high-level staffers, such as Manafort, about his potential Russian contacts during the campaign and received encouragement for his efforts.Papadopoulos was also not an adviser with no campaign experience, either.Before working with the Trump campaign, Papadopoulos was an adviser on Ben Carson's 2016 campaign.When the Carson campaign ended, he joined Trump's effort with the credentials he brought from Carson's team.When asked about why Papadopoulos joined the Trump campaign, a source familiar with the White House's thinking said, "He came from someone else's campaign.His expertise was energy.He had published papers.He looked good on paper."'Low level volunteer named George' JUST WATCHED Hear Trump's 2016 interview on Papadopoulos Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Who is George Papadopoulos?02:53 Claim One key to the statement of charges against Papadopoulos was that the former foreign policy adviser regularly emailed campaign officials and received encouragement from the officials to take a trip to meet with the foreign-born professor and his contacts with the Russian government.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told NBC Tuesday that Papadopoulos was "never a person who was part of a team that was interacting with senior management on a regular basis."Reality The former campaign manager's statement is contradicted by Mueller's statement of charges After a meeting where Papadopoulos' professor told him that he had met with Russian officials who have "dirt" on then-candidate Hillary Clinton, the foreign policy adviser "continued to correspond with Campaign officials ... in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and the Russian government."According to the statement of charges , Papadopoulos continued to exchange emails and calls with a "high-ranking campaign" officials and, after proposing a meeting between Russian officials and the campaign, his messages were discussed privately between two other campaign officials, which CNN has now identified, according to a congressional source, as Manafort and Gates.At one point, Papadopoulos' campaign supervisor said he would "encourage" him to make an off-the-record trip to meet with members of the Russian foreign ministry."I would encourage you ... (to) make the trip, if it is feasible," the campaign supervisor wrote, according to the statement of offense 'Long before they ... had any association with the campaign' Claim White House chief of staff John Kelly, in an interview on Monday, issued a blanket statement to all of Mueller's action on Manafort and Gates."These indictments were handed down, Paul Manafort of course, his associate Mr. Gates, and another minor aide to the Trump administration, George Papadopoulos," Fox News' Laura Ingraham asked."What's the administration's reaction?"Kelly responded: "All of the activity -- as I understand it, they were indicted for -- were long before they ever met Donald Trump or had any association with the campaign.But I think the reaction of the administration is let the legal justice system work, everyone's innocent until, presumed innocent, and we'll see where it goes."Reality Kelly is correct that Manafort and Gates' charges stem from activity that pre-dates their times with the Trump campaign.But the blanket statement that "all of the activity ... they were indicted for, were long before they ever met Donald Trump or had any association with the campaign" is not true when considering Papadopoulos.Mueller's statement of offense for Papadopoulos clearly details how his interactions with a foreign-born professor who in turn introduced him to Russian contacts began after -- and largely because -- of his involvement with the Trump campaign.In one passage, the complaints states that before Papadopoulos disclosed his involvement in the campaign, the professor with Russian contacts was "uninterested" in him.But once Papadopoulos disclosed his new role on the Trump campaign, the professor "appeared to take great interest" in him.The statement of charges later details Papadopoulos' repeated interactions with Trump campaign officials, including being encouraged by a campaign supervisor to meet with Russian contacts.The initial interaction between Papadopoulos and the professor happened in around March 14, 2016, according to the statement of offense.Trump name-checked Papadopoulos in an interview with The Washington Post a week later and then met with him as part of a broader "national security meeting" in Washington on March 31, 2016.Additionally, while the current charges against Manafort and Gates date back years, there is nothing stopping Mueller from charging the two top aides with more charges in the future.
Trump aide's suspected middleman knew about Clinton 'dirt' -- source:::::London (CNN) An academic suspected of being the link between a Trump campaign adviser and the Russian government told a business contact that Moscow had a trove of information about Hillary Clinton in April 2016, months before the information was public, CNN has learned.Joseph Mifsud, a London-based academic from Malta, also boasted of his connections with Moscow and talked about how he had dinner in a small group with President Vladimir Putin, the business contact and a former assistant told CNN.Mifsud matches the profile of "Foreign Contact 1" in the legal complaint against George Papadopoulos, a one-time Trump adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with foreign contacts.According to unsealed court papers Papadopoulos held a series of meetings in early 2016 with "Foreign Contact 1," also described as "the professor."Papadopoulos and Mifsud were Facebook friends, Papadopoulos' now-deleted Facebook account showed.Mifsud, who is not accused of wrongdoing, has not responded to multiple CNN attempts to contact him.He told the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper that the allegations were exaggerated."I have a clear conscience," he told the paper.Mifsud told the business contact in April 2016 that Moscow held a large amount of information about Hillary Clinton, who was then running for president.Mifsud said: "These guys (Russia) have a whole bunch of stuff on Clinton," the contact told CNN.According to court papers, the contact used similar language in a meeting with Papadopoulos, who was then a foreign policy aide to the Trump campaign."Papadopoulos further stated that Foreign Contact 1 told him that the Russians 'have dirt on her,' meaning Clinton, and that they have 'thousands of emails,'" the FBI affidavit says.That meeting, in London, also took place in April 2016.George Papadopoulos pictured in London A trove of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published in July 2016.A separate cache of emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign, was published in October and November 2016.Mifsud's profile matches in several key respects the figure described as "the professor" and "Foreign Contact 1" in Papadopoulos' FBI affidavit.The court papers describe him as a professor of diplomacy based in London who is a citizen of a country in the Mediterranean.Mifsud is from the Mediterranean island of Malta and is the honorary director of the London Academy of Diplomacy.The academy used to be attached to the University of East Anglia but later fell under the auspices of the University of Stirling in Scotland.The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that it was dissolved last year.The University of East Anglia confirmed that Mifsud held an honorary professorship there from August 2013 to July 2016."The University of East Anglia no longer has any links with the London Academy of Diplomacy or Joseph Mifsud," the university said in a statement to CNN.Mifsud is currently listed on Stirling University's website as a teaching fellow."Professor Joseph Mifsud has been a full-time professorial teaching fellow in the university's politics department since May 2017," Stirling University said in a statement.The business contact -- who requested anonymity in order to protect confidential relationships -- described Mifsud as being pro-Russian in outlook.Mifsud would boast about his links to Russia, the source told CNN, saying that he had been to the Black Sea resort city of Sochi and had dinner in a small group with President Vladimir Putin.The founder of the London Academy of Diplomacy and Mifsud's former employer, Nabil Ayad, told the Times of Malta that Mifsud knew a lot of senior Russians."He knew a number of top Russian officials because of these contacts.He has been involved in education for a considerable time," Ayad was quoted as saying.Papadopoulos told the FBI that his contact was flying to Moscow on April 18, 2016 for a conference.On April 19, Mifsud spoke at the Valdai Club, a think tank with close ties to Putin's government.Putin appears at the club every year for a headline event.Mifsud later gave an interview about energy policy for the Valdai Club Youtube channel.The Valdai Club said in a statement: "Mr Mifsud contributed his commentary to the Valdai Club in the past but no longer does so.All publicly available details are accessible on our website."A former assistant to Mifsud told CNN via a social media messaging service that she helped the professor to cultivate relationships with contacts in Russia.The former assistant, who did not want to be named, said Mifsud's interest in Russia was never a secret and that she helped introduce him to contacts at the Russia International Affairs Council -- a think tank funded by the Russian government -- and the "most top-ranked unis."The former assistant said she believed Mifsud attended an annual gathering at the Valdai Club every year since 2014, an event which she said was usually frequented by Putin.Mifsud bragged that he had met with

Manafort has 3 passports, traveled to China with phone registered under fake name:::::Washington (CNN) How rich are Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and where did they travel?That question lingered over the pair's court hearing on Monday after both faced the first indictments from Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Because both men appeared to be globe-trotting multi-millionaires and faced charges for serious crimes related to their work abroad, the government said they should be held under house arrest.A judge agreed Monday Among the highlights: * Manafort currently has three US passports, each under a different number.He has submitted 10 passport applications in roughly as many years, prosecutors said.* This year, Manafort traveled to Mexico, China and Ecuador with a phone and email account registered under a fake name.(The name was not disclosed in the filings.)* Over the past year, Manafort traveled to Dubai, Cancun, Panama City, Havana, Shanghai, Madrid, Tokyo and Grand Cayman Island.* Both Manafort and Gates were frequent travelers to Cyprus."Extensive travel of this nature further evidences a risk of flight," the prosecutor's filing said.* Manafort wrote on loan applications and other financial documents that his assets were worth between $19 million in April 2012 and $136 million in May 2016.* In some months, like while he served as Trump's national campaign chairman in August 2016, Manafort's assessment of his total worth fluctuated.In August 2016 he said his assets were worth $28 million, then wrote he had $63 million in assets on a different application.* Gates "frequently changed banks and opened and closed bank accounts," prosecutors said.In all, Gates opened 55 accounts with 13 financial institutions, the prosecutors' court filing said.Some of his bank accounts were in England and Cyprus, where he held more than $10 million from 2010 to 2013.Manafort's and Gates' attorneys have asked the judge to release them from house arrest Currently, Manafort and Gates' house arrest conditions mean they can only leave their homes to meet with lawyers or appear in court, or for medical and religious reasons, and they must check in with authorities daily.Their next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.They face sentences of more than 10 years if convicted on all charges.Both say they're not guilty.
Haley draws on her African visit when briefing Trump:::::(CNN) When she sat down to brief President Donald Trump about her trip to Africa last week, Nikki Haley was carrying the voices of the women she met and the stories they shared as she argued for deeper US engagement in Africa."I think it only makes me passionate.It only makes me more determined," Haley told a small group of reporters traveling with her."The strength and inspiration that we get from women in these challenging conditions, that's why you fight."During a week-long swing through Ethiopia, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo, Haley got a first-hand look at two of the continent's most brutal conflicts and most dire humanitarian crises.More than 4 million people each in South Sudan and Congo have been forced to flee their homes because of the violence.As the US ambassador to the United Nations, Haley has earned a reputation for blunt, tough talk, but her meetings with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and Congolese President Joseph Kabila marked her first serious foray into high-stakes diplomacy with world leaders.Haley brought reporters traveling with her to witness the top of each of her meetings, even refusing to join Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn until his security let American reporters in.While she visited refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan, Haley acknowledged she was unprepared for the level of suffering she witnessed in Africa.At a refugee camp in Ethiopia's Gambella region, she took off her shoes to play with South Sudanese children, gave polio drops to infants and joined a dance circle.She was overwhelmed during a meeting with women who told her horrifying tales of sexual violence, early marriage and watching their babies being thrown in the fire by the enemy."My heart is heavy," she told a small group of reporters traveling with her while still in the camp."No human being should live the way these people these people have lived, should have the memories that these people have and should feel the pain that they have felt.It's just inconceivable."It was that raw emotion that she took to South Sudan, which the US helped gain independence before it descended into civil war two years later.Haley showed President Kiir pictures of the misery she saw a day earlier."I told him that he couldn't deny the stories of his military, whether it was with violence or with rape or child soldiers and he can tell us all the words he wanted to say but his words don't match his actions," she recounted after the meeting."I told him that we need to see him right the ship and if he wants to he can."At a camp for displaced Congolese in the country's war-torn Kitchanga region, Haley held a single mother of seven while she broke down speaking of being raped in front of her children.She also visited a bakery started in the camp by a group of women, who found it too unsafe to leave the camp to buy bread.Having made a small profit, the women started a collective and told Haley they want to expand their business.JUST WATCHED Nikki Haley reflects amid displaced Congolese Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nikki Haley reflects amid displaced Congolese 02:22 With the two biggest and most expensive UN peacekeeping missions in South Sudan and Congo, Haley said on the eve of her trip she wanted to get a first-hand look at their effectiveness.But in proposing the trip to Trump, Haley acknowledged her larger goal was to bring high-level attention to the African conflicts, which she warned that, left unresolved, could metastasize into the next haven for terrorists plotting attacks against the United States.Her mission became all the more urgent in the wake of last month's ISIS ambush in Niger which killed four US servicemen."We have to deal with the situation here on the ground so that we are not dealing with it in the United States," she told CNN in an interview."What you have to look is these African countries and all countries, if they take care of their people, if they respect the voices of their people then you get true democracy.If they don't listen to the voices of their people, conflict will erupt.Extremism will happen, and the United States will have to deal with it.This is all about making sure we don't get to that place."In a 90-minute, one-on-one meeting, she urged Kabila, the Congolese president, to move toward elections -- warning him that his refusal to step aside is contributing to the violence and instability in the country.JUST WATCHED A trip inside South Sudan's refugee crisis Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A trip inside South Sudan's refugee crisis 02:02 Aides said they were surprised by her toughness going head-to-head with the African strongmen, but Haley said her previous life as a politician in South Carolina helped guide her."It helps me relate to them because the one thing that they can't deny is that they are politicians," she told CNN."I know what being a politician is like, and I know what they're capable of and what they're not capable of.And so, when they start to talk about what they don't control I remind them that they do."Haley seemed to have found a connection with Kiir, in Juba saying that he "responded accordingly with a lot of insight, depth, emotion and will on how he wants to go forward."Though the South Sudanese leader has broken repeated promises to the international community, Haley said their one-on-one meeting was an "intense back and forth that was meaningful to both of us in the hope of making a better South Sudan."Ten months into the job, Haley says it is challenging but finds the work rewarding and appreciates the flexibility given to her by the President, a condition she secured when she took the job.She said she doesn't "go over the reservation," but is also not tethered to talking points."If I just went out there and read a statement it's not going to do anything," she said."I can think for myself, I can do for myself.I am very aware of who I work for and very aware of the national security team and I'm very aware of doing everything in the best interests of the United States and for peace and security around the world and I'm very careful with how I use that flexibility."As a member of the National Security Council, Haley says she wants to help shape Trump's policies.She read out her trip to Trump, and National Security Adviser HR McMaster Tuesday and expects to meet with Vice President Pence next week, her office said.While in Africa, she said she planned to lay out the options and make recommendations only if asked.But she said her previous interactions with the President suggest he will be open to her opinion."He makes the decision.But he really does listen," she said.Despite the perception of Trump as being closed-minded, Haley said her boss is "very thoughtful and he knows a lot and when you put it in front of him and you give him a different side than what he's thinking, he really opens himself up to it."Haley also planned to discuss her trip with members of Congress and her colleagues on the security council.She was less enthusiastic about discussing her trip with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who she noted had been on travel.She said she would send a readout if it wasn't possible to meet.When asked about her interactions with Tillerson, Haley said "I see him at meetings, just like I see everyone else."She added that the whole national security team works together towards a common goal.Despite taking on more high-profile diplomatic assignments, Haley once again deflected speculation she could replace Tillerson if he were to leave early, saying she was happy in New York."I get to serve the country I love without dealing with a whole lot of drama."What remains to be seen is whether Haley can help turn the groundwork she laid last week into policy.US officials acknowledge the Trump administration has been slow to communicate a vision for Africa.Tillerson has yet to hire an Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and the White House only brought in a senior Africa director two months ago.In keeping with his America First foreign policy that limits US engagement abroad, Trump has also promised to cut foreign aid, and slashed assistance for Africa in his first budget.When asked whether she would press for more assistance after her trip, Haley said foreign aid is "the heart and soul of the American people.""We've never could turn our backs while people are suffering," she said."We are always going to fight for people who can't fight for themselves.That's in the American DNA."Her noted that her strongest argument for deeper US engagement may lay with the children she encountered growing up in refugee and displacement camps.Haley said many of those she spoke with were unsure of how old they even were."Those kids will be 18 one day," Haley said of the children being affected by the conflicts."They will be an uneducated adult with no social skills that will have resented the fact that they were put in that situation and that's dangerous for the United States and that's dangerous for the world."Though they likely didn't know exactly who Haley was, the dozens of Congolese children at the Mungote camp knew she was important enough to run after her and wave as she left.Haley waved enthusiastically back as she boarded her UN helicopter back to base.Once the helicopter took off, she put her head in her hands and cried.
Trump administration set to slap Cuba at the UN:::::Washington (CNN) The Trump administration will deliver a slap to Cuba by voting against a November 1 United Nations resolution calling for the end of its embargo on the Caribbean island.Last year, the Obama administration abstained from the vote, breaking with a longstanding tradition of voting "no" as part of its efforts to foster better relations, a campaign that included re-opening the US embassy in Havana and a visit by then-President Barack Obama.This year, mysterious sonic attacks on US diplomats are shadowing the relationship, which had already soured under President Donald Trump's more hostile stance toward Havana.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US decision to vote against the UN resolution , which Cuba has brought every year for the last 26, is meant to "underscore" the Trump administration's Cuba policy."We plan to vote against the resolution to underscore this new approach to Cuba," Nauert said, noting that the US has historically voted against it."The Trump administration policy gives greater emphasis in advancing human rights and democracy in Cuba, while maintaining engagement that serves US national interests."Read More
Government argues against access to US detainee:::::Story highlights The ACLU petitioned for "immediate and unmonitored access" to the individual The American was turned over to US forces by the US-backed Kurdish-led group fighting in ISIS last month Washington (CNN) The Trump administration argued against granting the ACLU access to an unnamed US citizen detained for allegedly fighting for ISIS in Syria, according to a motion filed in federal court Monday.Government attorneys filed the response in the US District Court for the District of Columbia after the civil rights group petitioned the court for "immediate and unmonitored access" to the individual who was turned over to US forces by the US-backed Kurdish-led group fighting ISIS last month.The individual is currently being held in Iraq.At the time, the Defense Department said the International Committee of the Red Cross had been notified of the detention and was working with US authorities to organize a visit, which according to the government's filing has now taken place.In its filing, the government argued that since the ACLU has no "significant relationship" with the detainee, it "cannot show that it would act in the detainee's best interests when it has never conferred with the detainee in order to learn what those interests are," according to the filing.Read More
Why Mueller isn't charging anyone with 'collusion':::::(CNN) Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's double-barreled court actions on Monday have revved up talk of possible "collusion" between Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.But as those filings suggest, cases are likely to be built on less sensational sounding charges, such as making false statements.There is no actual federal crime of "collusion" in this kind of investigation, even though the word is popularly used to describe possible complicity between Trump associates and Russian operatives who tried to influence the 2016 presidential election.Trump himself invoked the word "collusion" in a tweet on Tuesday related to the indictment of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, declaring that Manafort's lawyer said "there was 'no collusion' and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign."In fact, Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts tied to, among other offenses, unregistered lobbying with a foreign power and money laundering.They have pleaded not guilty.Many allegations date back years before the 2016 campaign, yet the two men are accused of laundering money through US and foreign corporations and bank accounts into 2016.Separately, new public documents show that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with people connected to Russians who wanted to offer the Trump campaign "dirt" on 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Read More
Historians say John Kelly has the Civil War wrong:::::Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday defended White House chief of staff John Kelly, after his praise of Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man" and comments that the Civil War began because of "the lack of an ability to compromise."Kelly's comments, made during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, re-ignited a political firestorm sparked earlier this year about whether Confederate generals should still be venerated with statues in American cities.Specifically, he was asked about a decision by a Virginia church to remove plaques celebrating Lee and George Washington."I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man," Kelly said."He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now it's different today.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had made them stand."In defending Kelly's comments to reporters on Tuesday, Sanders accused reporters of creating a false narrative around them."Because you don't like history doesn't mean that you can erase it and pretend that it didn't happen," Sanders said."I think that's the point that Gen. Kelly was trying to make.To try to create something and push a narrative that simply doesn't exist is just frankly outrageous and absurd."Sanders also referenced the historian Shelby Foote, who in the 1990 Ken Burns documentary "The Civil War" made a similar argument that a failure to compromise was at the root of the problem."It was because we failed to do the thing we really have a genius for, which is compromise," Foote said."Americans like to think of themselves as uncompromising.Our true genius is for compromise.Our whole government's founded on it.And, it failed."Noting that she didn't want to re-litigate the Civil War, Sanders mentioned Foote's comments and said there were "a lot of historians that think that and there are a lot of different versions of those compromises."Burns himself responded to that argument Tuesday in a tweet, saying: "Many factors contributed to the Civil War.One caused it: slavery."Many factors contributed to the Civil War.One caused it: slavery.Ken Burns (@KenBurns) October 31, 2017 A number of historians and journalists were sharply critical of Kelly's comments and Sanders' defense, accusing the chief of staff of misunderstanding the key issue over which the Civil War began."I think Kelly's comments marginalize the central issue of the war, which was the expansion of slavery," Edna Greene Medford, a professor of history at Howard University, told CNN."Absolutely, there were differences over the expansion of that institution which led to secession and secession led to war, but to conclude that it's about people not being able to compromise, it's just too simplistic."Jim Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, called the idea of compromise an "interesting" notion, and asked what compromise there could possibly be."George W. Bush has referred to slavery as 'America's original sin,'" Grossman said."What compromise was available once states had made it clear that they would secede from any nation that would interfere with their right to own human beings?Prolonging the enslavement of those people?"What's more, Grossman added, the declarations of secession made clear that states were "seceding from the union to preserve the institution of slavery.""That would suggest to me that anyone who thinks there could have been a compromise is either engaging in the fantasies of the old South that were created at the end of the 19th century, or feels that the enslavement of people could have been prolonged in order to maintain peace."Hmmm.What exactly, I wonder, would be the right "compromise" between slavery and freedom for human beings?https://t.co/ZWwpwCSGzx Rep Frederica Wilson (@RepWilson) October 31, 2017 The debate over Civil War history is long-simmering but has reached new heights during the Trump administration.That heightening and Kelly's comments come at a time during which President Donald Trump has been scrutinized for his response to racial acrimony.Some critics drew parallels between Kelly's comments to Ingraham and Trump's inciting remarks earlier this year in which he blamed both sides for the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one counter protester dead after a car crashed into a crowd.Many attempts at compromise Others, like Judith Giesberg, a Civil War historian at Villanova University, pointed out that the United States offered a number of compromises before the war erupted in 1861.She and others pointed to the Corwin Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have prohibited Congress from abolishing slavery."That was the ultimate attempt to compromise," Giesberg said of what would have been the 13th Amendment."It actually passed Congress which is quite stunning if you think about where the country was in 1865 passing a 13th Amendment that prohibited slavery."When he ran for president in 1860, Abraham Lincoln said repeatedly that he wanted to prevent the expansion of slavery into the western territories that had not yet become states.But he said he would not seek to interfere with slavery where it already existed.The author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has written extensively about the Civil War, wrote on Twitter that the "notion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from America's founding," noting the existence of the Three-Fifths Compromise, The Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act among others."Shocking that someone charged with defending their country, in some profound way, does not comprehend the country they claim to defend," Coates tweeted.In the same interview with Ingraham, Kelly made an argument about applying the standards of right and wrong today to events that happened centuries ago."I think we make a mistake, though, and as a society and certainly as, as individuals, when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100, 200, 300 years or more and say what those, you know, what Christopher Columbus did was wrong," he said."You know, 500 years later, it's inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then."When it comes to Lee and the Civil War though, historians rejected the notion that modern-day values were being projected onto past events.Notion that we are putting today's standards on the past is, in itself, racist--implies only white, slave-holding, opinions matter.Ta-Nehisi Coates (@tanehisicoates) October 31, 2017 "I think it would be preposterous to criticize a pope in 900 AD for not having contemporary ideas about ethnic diversity.But when we are talking about the American Civil War, there were contemporaries of Lee who made a very different decision than he did," Fitzhugh Brundage, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said, noting that there were "plenty of Americans who believed that slavery were such an evil that they were willing to put their lives on the line to destroy [it].""That's not somehow me being present-ist and imposing my values on them.Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln and others had a different set of values," Brundage said."So I think we could judge Robert E. Lee against his own contemporaries without having to impose our own present-day moral values."
Kelly: 'Lack of an ability to compromise' led to Civil War:::::Washington (CNN) White House chief of staff John Kelly spoke to the "good" and "not so good" parts of US history on Monday, speaking highly of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and attributing the origin of the American Civil War to a "lack of an ability to compromise."Kelly described history as "evolving," and said it is "dangerous" to not be cognizant of it, when asked about the removal of historical but controversial statues commemorating Confederate figures during an interview on Fox News' "The Ingraham Angle.""There will be, 100 or 200 years from now, people that criticize us for what we do, and I guess they'll tear down, you know, statues of people that we revere today," Kelly told Laura Ingraham."It's dangerous, I think....It's just very, very dangerous and it shows you what, how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is."The White House chief of staff called Lee "an honorable man" who chose duty to his state over loyalty to a federal government."It was always loyalty to state first back in those days," Kelly said."Now, it's different today."Read More
Hope Hicks to be interviewed by Mueller's team:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's communications director Hope Hicks, one of his closest and longest-serving aides, is set to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team in mid-November, a White House official confirmed to CNN.Mueller's team is interviewing White House officials "regularly" and "deliberately" over the coming weeks, and this official expects Mueller could conclude interviews with White House officials by Thanksgiving.Some administration officials are expected to be interviewed by Mueller's team while Trump is on a 12-day trip to Asia.The officials with whom Mueller has sought interviews who are traveling on the trip -- like Hicks -- will be interviewed when they return, the official said.Hicks' attorney Robert Trout did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Read More
Kelly on WH reaction to indictments: 'let the legal justice system work':::::Washington (CNN) White House chief of staff John Kelly said the reaction of the Trump administration to Monday's news of indictments is to "let the legal justice system work.""I think the reaction of the administration is let the legal justice system work, everyone's innocent until -- presumed innocent -- and we'll see where it goes," Kelly said on Fox News' "The Ingraham Angle" on Monday night.Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates surrendered Monday to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, and former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that the President has "no intention or plan" to fire Mueller.Kelly also shared a similar sentiment to President Donald Trump's initial reaction Monday morning, when the President tweeted: "Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????"Read More
Trump rejecting Bannon's hard line against Mueller:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has decided -- for now -- to stick with his strategy of cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller, a day after the Russia investigation ensnared three of his campaign aides .That's despite being urged to take a harder line by his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.Bannon spoke with Trump following Monday's announcements from the special counsel, and advocated taking a harsher approach to Mueller, a person familiar with their conversation said.While Trump encouraged Bannon to lead the public charge against Mueller, the President made clear to aides Tuesday that he's not adopting Bannon's advice.In the wake of Bannon's criticism, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said again Tuesday the President had no plans of changing his tack with Mueller."I have a high degree of confidence that the facts in this case dictate the course that we're on," Cobb told CNN, "and have contributed to the special counsel's ability to move expeditiously -- and, ideally, to be in a position to reach a prompt resolution and conclusion."Could reverse course JUST WATCHED Trump lawyer: Charges not related to campaign Replay More Videos ...

Bannon's calls to take a harder line against Mueller -- including pushing to cut his funding and insisting he limit the scope of his investigation -- were seen by some inside the White House as at odds with the strategy of representing a client who has nothing to hide.The administration has already been cooperating, including turning over troves of email, in a decision that cannot suddenly be undone."This is Bannon's wishful thinking," a person close to the President said."It's never going to happen.It's just not going to happen."But the very public suggestions from Bannon do allow the President to have an outside-inside strategy: cooperating with the investigation internally in hopes of reaching a faster conclusion, even while supporting those who loudly criticize it from the outside.The latest example of White House cooperation came late Tuesday, as an administration official confirmed that communications director Hope Hicks, one of the President's closest aides, agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's team in November.Several other aides are also set to be interviewed by the special counsel's office in the coming weeks, while others already have been.The conversations about a legal strategy took center stage on Tuesday at the White House, where press secretary Sarah Sanders said the President did not support Bannon's call to squeeze funding for the special counsel's office or to push back harder on Mueller."No," Sanders said."I'm not sure what we'd push back against.All they've done is come up with ways and shown more and more that there was no connection between the Trump campaign and collusion with Russia."Asked directly whether the President was pleased with his current legal team, Sanders said: "I'm not sure how he couldn't.""All of the revelations that have taken place over the last several days and hours have nothing to do with the President and have nothing to do with the campaign," Sanders said."I think the further we get into it, the more and more we see that happen."A day after two of Trump's campaign aides were indicted and a third was revealed to have pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI -- with whom he's now cooperating -- Trump made repeated attempts to return to his governing agenda, which he's urgently working to revive.A pall over the West Wing JUST WATCHED Manafort attorney: No Russia collusion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Manafort attorney: No Russia collusion 01:21 But even as Trump looks ahead to a tax reform fight and a lengthy trip to Asia, there remained a pall over the West Wing as aides and associates continued to grapple with the contents of Monday's legal announcements.While most of Trump's staff -- and the President himself -- had long expected former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates to be indicted by the special counsel, the guilty plea by George Papadopoulos, a campaign foreign policy adviser, came seemingly from nowhere.Aides who worked on the campaign struggled to remember the man who court documents revealed sought to arrange meetings between members of the Trump campaign and top ranking Kremlin officials.The notion that such an unassuming figure could be caught in Mueller's net had some Trump aides on edge.The suggestion in the documents that he is cooperating with the FBI investigation -- including the possibility that he's worn a wire to collect information from other campaign associates -- has prompted a degree of consternation among Trump associates, who now wonder who else might be working with Mueller's team.Members of Trump's staff are "freaked out," one person close to the White House said, with some aides wondering "who has been trying to bait me?"The President himself is similarly concerned there could be other unforeseen indictments coming down that neither he nor his legal team have anticipated."He's insane about it because he's wondering how many of these things are there out there that I don't know about?"the person close to the President said.Trump remains focused elsewhere JUST WATCHED White House answers Manafort questions (full briefing) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House answers Manafort questions (full briefing) 17:34 The White House insists that Trump's focus is elsewhere -- namely, his upcoming push on tax reform and the 12-day slog through Asia which commences on Friday.During a series of meetings meant to bolster his push for tax reform, Trump ignored questions about Monday's dramatic series of events.He also ignored questions about whether he would work to short-circuit the Russia investigation, either by moving to dismiss Mueller or by pardoning his associates caught up in Mueller's probe."Thank you, all.Thank you, everybody.Thank you very much.Thank you," Trump said after a reporter asked him in the Roosevelt Room if he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the onetime chairman of his presidential campaign who on Monday surrendered himself to law enforcement.The media was soon gone from the room.He remained similarly mum on questions about Papadopoulos, who was arrested over the summer by the FBI and has been cooperating with the investigation since.Outwardly, Trump was attempting to remain focused on the tax reform push, which will reach a head on Wednesday when congressional Republicans unveil specifics of their plan.Trump has asked key members of his administration -- including daughter Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin -- to forgo tagging along on his upcoming trip to Asia to instead remain in Washington to lobby for the plan.Trump arrived to the West Wing just before noon on Tuesday for talks with business leaders about the tax reform plan.He has spent the bulk of the past two mornings inside his private White House residence, including in talks with his legal team about the Russia proceedings.His time in his top floor residence has also been spent on the phone with certain longtime friends and advisers, each of whom has offered varied advice on handling the Russia probe.Some have recommended he fire Mueller, a move the President has considered in the past.But for now he's rejected those suggestions at the advice of his legal team and top White House aides.On Capitol Hill, Republicans downplayed the prospects that Trump could fire Mueller, noting that step would require sign-off by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who oversees the Russia probe."The efforts that are out there are to circumvent the President firing the special counsel -- he can't do that," said Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee who is leading his own investigation into Russian election interference.But asked whether he could ensure Trump and his allies would not apply pressure on Rosenstein to dismiss Mueller, Burr was noncommittal."I can't be confident on anything," he said.
Trump 'seething' as Mueller probe reaches former aides:::::Washington (CNN) The dramatic intensification of the Russia investigation on Monday reignited President Donald Trump's fury at the controversy clouding his presidency, prompting his aides to urgently advise him against lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller as they work to revive a halting policy agenda.Watching the developments unfold on the large television screens installed in his private residence, Trump was "seething," according to a Republican close to the White House.The indictments on Monday of campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates weren't a surprise to Trump, according to people who have spoken with the President.Trump has long assumed that members of his presidential campaign would be swept up in Mueller's probe.The revelation that another campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos , pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI was far less expected, the sources said.And the assumption that Papadopoulos is cooperating with the FBI's Russia probe stirred even more unease among Trump's allies.Even as the White House sought to downplay the developments, the charges only served to fuel questions about Trump's ties to Russia, which he has angrily denied and worked to discredit.A question Trump asked on Twitter -- punctuated by five question marks -- offered the clearest window into his mindset: "But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????"Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017 The President's attempt to change the subject was complicated by the highly detailed indictments of his two former aides , which painted Manafort as a well-compensated broker of pro-Russian interests.It was complicated even more by the unveiling of a guilty plea from a third adviser who had repeated contacts with officials close to the Kremlin -- the clearest connection so far between the Trump campaign and Russia.As revelations from the Russia investigation rocked Washington on Monday, Trump spent much of the day hunkered down, surrounded by only a handful of aides in the third-story living quarters of the White House.Huddled with members of his legal team -- including Ty Cobb, his in-house lawyer focused on the Mueller probe; John Dowd, an outside legal adviser; and Jay Sekulow, who called into the White House from his base in Nashville -- Trump was bolstered by the sense among his team that the charges against Manafort bore only the loosest connections to the presidential campaign.He griped that Manafort's role on his campaign had taken outsized importance in the media, and insisted his former chairman played only a minor role.Senior aides, according to a senior White House official, expected Mueller to target top members of Trump's campaign team like Manafort, but the addition of Papadopoulos surprised the President."The President is going, 'Really, this is the guy?'" a senior White House official said in describing Trump's reaction to Papadopoulos' guilty plea.As the morning carried on, however, Trump grew increasingly frustrated as he viewed cable news coverage of his onetime campaign chairman arriving at the FBI field office in downtown Washington, believing his former aides' roles were being inflated.Full combat mode JUST WATCHED CNN's Acosta: How is this not collusion?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN's Acosta: How is this not collusion?01:25 The West Wing suddenly was back in full combat mode, with an internal tug-of-war emerging over how aggressively Trump should seek to discredit Mueller and his investigation.Even as White House lawyers urged the President to avoid directly criticizing Mueller, other advisers -- including his former chief strategist Steve Bannon -- suggested he aggressively push back."Calling for Mueller's firing would undercut the White House argument," one senior administration official told CNN.Cobb, a White House lawyer, has been a leading voice inside the West Wing to urge cooperation with Mueller's investigation.White House chief of staff John Kelly has reinforced that argument inside the administration.Both have told Trump that providing Mueller with information -- including, potentially, an interview with the President himself -- would allow the investigation to reach a conclusion quicker.Their recommendations have gone beyond simply cooperation, however; Cobb and Kelly have both warned Trump that spouting off on Mueller on Twitter or during friendly interviews on Fox News would backfire badly.For the past several months, Trump has largely followed that advice.But as word of indictments emerged late last week, other members of his team -- both West Wing aides and informal advisers -- have said that Trump's kid-gloves approach to Mueller has yielded no results.Bannon, who was dismissed in August, has told associates that Trump's legal team is steering the President in the wrong direction, and has suggested a more combative approach to Mueller, according to administration officials.A source familiar with Bannon's thinking tells CNN that he is urging the President to start to fight back aggressively against Mueller.He wants the White House to get Republicans to cut funding, publicly debate Mueller's mandate and slow down document production in court.But so far there is no evidence that Trump is willing to change course and several Republican lawmakers have warned against going after Mueller."The President frequently changes his mind," said one person familiar with the President's legal strategy, "and we are always revisiting every plan."Another person familiar with the President's thinking said it wouldn't be surprising for more lawyers to join Trump's legal team.'Continuing to cooperate' JUST WATCHED Kevin Madden: today could be tip of the iceberg in Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kevin Madden: today could be tip of the iceberg in Mueller probe 08:37 Many of the President's allies have privately speculated that Monday's indictments only made it more likely he would ultimately find some way of hampering the probe, including potentially dismissing Mueller.Cobb took care to note in a statement the President was "continuing to cooperate" with the special counsel's office and investigation, and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders would only say Monday the President has "no intention or plan" to fire Mueller.During his morning session with his lawyers, Trump asked for an explanation of the federal grand jury indictment process, and why a sealed indictment was used, according to a senior White House official.He was also interested to know whether the indictments signaled that the investigation is speeding up toward its conclusion, the official said.Officially, the White House insists the probe is nearing its end."We still expect this to conclude soon," Sanders said.But privately, there are few legal experts or even close allies of Trump who believe Mueller is close to finished.A sense of tension and uncertainty was palpable in the West Wing on Monday, officials said, as they sought to keep the President focused on the week's busy calendar.The dramatic scaling up of Mueller's investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia comes ahead of what the White House hoped would be a policy-centric several weeks, with the opportunity to reset an off-course agenda.Republicans on Wednesday are set to visit the White House after unveiling their tax plan on Capitol Hill.Trump is expected to introduce Jerome Powell as his Federal Reserve chairman on Thursday.And on Friday he departs for a 12-day trip to Asia, where North Korea's nuclear threat will demand full attention.Presidential trip looms JUST WATCHED Analyzing Mueller's first indictments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Analyzing Mueller's first indictments 04:36 Trump's Asia swing amounts to the longest presidential trip to that continent in decades, a fact that has some of his advisers anxious about the results that jet lag and a foreign environment could have on the President's mindset.It won't be the first time Trump has departed overseas just as a swirl of Russia-related scandal mounts back home.A day before he departed for his first presidential foreign trip in May, the Justice Department appointed Mueller as special counsel, ensuring the story would follow Trump on his stops in the Middle East and Europe.Trump avoided tweeting almost entirely on that first swing, his cantankerous mood tempered by the presence of his wife, Melania, and a rapid-pace schedule that included stops in five countries.Some of Trump's advisers have already expressed the hope his trip to Asia proceeds in similar fashion -- though they acknowledge that attempts to rein in Trump's behavior often result in the President entrenching himself in the very actions his advisers recommended against.Trump, meanwhile, has expressed concern the special counsel's ongoing investigation could hurt his ability to negotiate with foreign leaders as he prepares to head to Asia."He worries about his ability to negotiate with various entities and how much he's hamstrung by this," the official said, adding the President feels hobbled by the investigation and he and the White House believe he will be in a stronger position politically and internationally once the investigation concludes.At the heart of the President's fury is the very existence of the special counsel, for which he still blames Attorney General Jeff Session and his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.At a previously scheduled lunch on Monday with Sessions in the private dining room just off the Oval Office, an official said the President did not raise the Russia investigation.Rather, a spokesman said, they talked about immigration, the opioid epidemic and upcoming judicial appointments.And Trump revealed few outward worries when he emerged in public late in the day Monday to greet trick-or-treaters from a spider-webbed White House South Portico.With Michael Jackson's "Thriller" blaring from the speakers, Trump handed out plastic-wrapped cookies and high-fived costumed kids -- including a skeleton in a "Make America Great Again" hat.But when a reporter shouted a question about the day's indictments, all Trump did was wave.
Mueller probe may ground Trump's unconventional success:::::Washington (CNN) Donald Trump can't tweet his way out of this one.The President's tried and tested political defense mechanism is to whip up chaos to tip his enemies off balance and launch a fierce counter attack.He'll also take cover with his ultra-loyal political base, rely on Republicans who are too cowed to repudiate him and fog an issue with alternative facts.Like clockwork, Trump sought Tuesday morning to discredit the probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and his campaign's potential role in it."The Fake News is working overtime.As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign.Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.Check the DEMS!"Trump said in a series of tweets."I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!"The Fake News is working overtime.As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he... ....came to the campaign.Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.Check the DEMS!I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!But Robert Mueller's first big splash Monday suggested that Trump's methodology -- which has helped him defy all the normal rules of electoral politics and the presidency -- will face its sternest test yet with the relentless special counsel.As the events of a dramatic day unfolded, there was a sense that the White House was being forced to engage on Mueller's home turf rather than in the wild and whirling political environment where Trump feels most at home.Mueller's first indictments of former Trump campaign aides , the unveiling of a surprise guilty plea by a former campaign foreign policy adviser and the manner in which he set out his case suggest his probe is sweeping, strategic and steeped in detail.And it's clear he's just getting started."The criminal justice interest being vindicated here is there's a large-scale ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part," said Aaron Zelinsky of the special counsel's office in a plea hearing for former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that was unsealed on Monday.In fact, Mueller's methodical performance suggests that Trump's orbit has much to fear from Mueller, a foe who is far more consequential than his folding GOP primary rivals, a tainted Hillary Clinton or the "fake" media -- all of which have struggled to find answers to his unorthodox approach.First salvo JUST WATCHED Former Trump adviser cooperates with Mueller Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former Trump adviser cooperates with Mueller 02:22 Mueller's command of the Washington game and mechanics of the law, on show in his first salvo against the Trump team, also represent a test for Trump's instinctive mastery of disruption and diversion."This was an impressive strategy that played out," Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant director of the FBI's counter intelligence division, told CNN.Figliuzzi said Mueller, by unveiling a sealed plea deal with Papadopoulos, was sending a message to other potential targets in the case that if they wanted to play hardball, he had people cooperating with him.Of course, if Trump has nothing to hide, then he has nothing to fear from Mueller, who has still yet to prove any clear evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia -- the most explosive allegation facing those around the President.But faced with his resourceful new adversary, Trump's go-to mode of defense -- a tweet in capital letters -- seemed hardly adequate."There is NO COLLUSION!"the President wrote on Twitter.....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017 As it sought to find its balance, the White House was quick to seek out vulnerabilities in Mueller's initial gambit.But it was also immediately clear that its efforts, while serviceable in a political context, were much less suited to the constraining legal reality that is now facing Trump."Today's announcement has nothing to do with the President, has nothing to do with the President's campaign or campaign activity," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.People close to the White House, meanwhile, set about undermining the credibility of cooperating witness Papadopoulos, describing him as an overzealous low-level adviser who was a "zero" in terms of campaign seniority.One White House official told CNN the President was bewildered by Papadopoulos being swept up in the case, apparently seeking to further diminish his role as a linchpin in Mueller's presentation."The President is going, 'Really, this is the guy?'"the official said.But CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said that while such arguments may make sense politically, they are irrelevant to Mueller's mandate -- to probe whether there was collusion between any Trump associate and Russia."The directive was not a certain level official, a certain level of campaign person," said Coates."To try to parse it in this way belies all logic to me legally."Even if the timeline of the charges against Manafort and Gates, related to their work for a formerly pro-Russian government in Ukraine, covers a period before they worked for Trump, the pair might pose a threat to the White House in other ways -- a possibility that Sanders did not address.Given the gravity of the charges against them which carry long potential prison terms, and their treatment -- both are now under house arrest -- each man has a strong incentive to cooperate with Mueller's investigation."If I was representing Paul Manafort, unless I was sure my client was getting a pardon, I would be talking to him about potentially cooperating with Mr. Mueller," said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti on CNN.Political spin JUST WATCHED CNN's Acosta: How is this not collusion?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN's Acosta: How is this not collusion?01:25 In her briefing, Sanders also renewed the political charge that Clinton's campaign -- and not Trump -- was guilty of colluding with Russia, citing the infamous Fusion GPS dossier on the President's alleged past ties with Russia.But if the events and documentation made public Monday prove anything, it is that the political spin on which the White House has relied to dismiss the building storm over the Russia drama may not be enough to help Trump aides, and even the President himself, this time.From court filings and other documents, it is also clear that Mueller is operating on a broad canvas.Despite Trump's insistence last week that it is now "commonly accepted" that there is no collusion involved, Monday's developments show that is a line that is being seriously pursued.By indicting Manafort and Gates on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, he is sending a signal he is willing to target wrongdoing in diverse forms.That may chill those around a President who has warned that he would see any attempt by Mueller to probe his family finances as an overreach.It was also another poor day Monday for Trump's increasingly thin claim that the Russia matter is nothing more than a "hoax" perpetrated by Democrats still sore about Clinton's 2016 election debacle.In documents outlining Papadopoulos' guilty plea, Mueller laid out what appear to be clear attempts by Russian intelligence to court the former foreign policy advisor, through someone identified as a "professor," a Russian foreign ministry official -- likely a cover for an intelligence officer, and a woman he believed to be President Vladimir Putin's niece.He also delivers a hint that he may not be done with Manafort -- including evidence showing that Papadopoulos emailed the campaign manager with the news that Russia wanted to meet with Trump.He bolstered the case for collusion -- in contradiction of the White House claim that there is nothing to answer for -- by including an FBI statement saying that, as late as August 2016, a campaign superior told Papadopoulos to go ahead with a trip to Russia to meet officials.But the most daunting disclosure for the Trump camp may be the comment by attorney Aaron Zelinsky on Mueller's team that the Papadopoulos question was part of a "road map" of a much larger case.Faced with such challenges Trump has few options.Were he to try to dismiss Mueller, in a similar manner to the way he dispensed with FBI chief James Comey, he could incite a constitutional crisis.Trump's reflex to lash out in fact in the Comey case is the reason he is facing a special counsel probe in the first place.Should Trump pardon Manafort and Gates, he could close down the case but ignite a political firestorm.So he may have little option to sit and wait, and watch the special counsel weave his web.
Papadopoulos' guilty plea is much bigger problem for Trump than the Manafort indictment:::::(CNN) Even a s President Trump was on Twitter insisting that the indictment of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was meaningless because it involved activities unrelated to Trump or the campaign came news that former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos had pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with, wait for it, Russia.The Manafort news drew the bigger headlines Monday morning -- understandable given his high-profile role at the top of the Trump campaign.But, the Papadopoulos guilty plea -- and the fact that he has been cooperating with the special counsel investigation since his July arrest -- strikes me as significantly more problematic for Trump and his White House in the medium-to-long term."In truth and in fact, however, and as set forth above, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the Professor for the first time on or about March 14, 2016, after defendant PAPADOPOULOS had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the Campaign; the Professor showed interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS only after learning of his role on the Campaign; and the Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the Russians possessing" dirt" on then-candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after defendant PAPADOPOULOS had joined the Campaign."So, Papadopoulos copped to lying to the FBI about the timing of his contacts with Russians.In his initial interview in January 2017, Papadopoulos was insistent that he had reached out to his foreign contact "The Professor" (amazing!)before he had formally joined the Trump presidential campaign.He was arrested in July, pleaded guilty in October and appears to have been cooperating in between.And, most importantly the "Professor" only showed interest in Papadopoulos after it became known that he was employed by the Trump campaign.That.Is.A.Very.Big.Deal.The obvious question is why Papadopolous initially lied to the FBI -- despite being warned that doing so would have major consequences.Why, if there was nothing to hide about his relationship -- or attempted relationship with Russian officials -- would Papadopoulos feel the need to put himself in serious legal jeopardy by lying about the timing of his conversations with "the Professor"?We don't know the answer to that question.But, we do know one reason why Papadopoulos was pursuing the relationship with the Russians; he believed they had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton.This, again from Papadopoulos' plea agreement, makes that plain: "On or about April 26, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the Professor for breakfast at a London hotel.During this meeting, the Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials.The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that on that trip he (the Professor) learned that the Russians had obtained "dirt" on then-candidate Clinton.The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS, as defendant PAPADOPOULOS later described to the FBI, that "They [the Russians] have dirt on her"; "the Russians had emails of Clinton"; "they have thousands of emails."The broad goal of the Russian contact with Papadopoulos was to get Trump to visit Russia during the campaign -- a visit where he would huddle with Russian officials and maybe even meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Obviously, that trip never happened.George Papadopoulos in an undated photo.So, to recap: 1."The Professor" only expressed interest in Papadopoulos after it became clear that he would play a role in the Trump campaign as a foreign policy advisor.2.Papadopoulos lied about the timing of his interactions with "The Professor."Those lies were aimed at suggesting the interactions came before Papadopoulos was an adviser to the Trump campaign.But, in fact, those interactions were because Papadopoulos worked for Trump, not in spite of them 3.Papadopoulos' interactions with "The Professor" were driven by the promise of "dirt" on Clinton in the from of "thousands of emails" regarding Clinton.4.Papadopoulos seems to have been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation since July.Given all of that, it's much harder for Trump and his allies to dismiss Papadopoulos than Manafort.What's more, court documents make clear he was in contact with high-ranking campaign officials about his contacts with the Russians.A senior former campaign adviser told CNN's Gloria Borger that Papadopoulos was not a major player."He was a zero.A non-event," the adviser said.But, what Papadopolous has already admitted to doing -- lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian operatives regarding "dirt" on Trump's general election opponent -- is a very big deal.A bigger deal -- in terms of the investigation into Russia's attempted meddling in the election and allegations of collusion -- than the dozen counts laid out in the Manafort indictment.And the day is still young!
Carter Page: Russia 'may have come up' in his Trump campaign emails:::::(CNN) Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page admitted that the topic of Russia "may have come up" in emails with campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to charges of making a false statement to the FBI about his contact with Russian government officials.In an interview on MSNBC, Page, who's scheduled to testify behind closed doors before a House intelligence committee panel Thursday, said he "might have been" on email threads with Papadopoulos where Russia "may have come up from time to time," but clarified that "nothing major" was discussed.Page, who told the Senate intelligence committee in May he had "brief interactions" with low-level Russian officials in 2013, traveled to Moscow in July 2016 , shortly after Papadopoulos forwarded a request from Russian officials to meet with Trump or someone in the Trump campaign.In May, Papadopoulos had sent an email to a "high-ranking campaign official" with the subject line "Request from Russia to meet Mr.Trump."The email said Russian officials were eager to meet with the candidate and had been reaching out.However, Page rebuffed the idea that he met with Russian officials during his July trip in his capacity as a campaign adviser, telling Hayes that his trip was separate from his campaign role."I definitely did not represent anyone from the Trump campaign during my trip," and "was always there just as a private citizen," he said.Page also said that, during his time in Moscow, he "had no meetings, no serious discussions with anyone high up or at any official capacity," and that he "knew nothing" about Papadopoulos's attempt to set up a meeting between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.In the interview, Page also tried to downplay any contact he had with Papadopoulos, noting "there were tons of emails happening on a lot of different things" during his time with the campaign, but that he "definitely didn't hear anything" on Russian attempts to hack emails from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign.Page also shrugged off questions on if he's sought legal counsel, saying, "I'm very, very open and happy to give all the information I can in the interest of really getting the truth out there," adding: "I think the truth will set a lot of people free."

Maryland investigating Kushner Companies over apartments:::::The Maryland attorney general is investigating one of the Kushner family's real estate businesses after media reports surfaced earlier this year about allegedly abusive debt collection practices and poor conditions at several of its properties.Kushner Companies said it is cooperating with Attorney General Brian Frosh, Maryland's top legal officer."We have been working with the Maryland Attorney General's Office to provide information in response to its request," Kushner Companies told CNN through a spokesperson."We are in compliance with all state and local laws."A Baltimore-based attorney is working with Kushner Companies on the matter, according to a person familiar with the attorney general's inquiry.A spokesperson for the AG's office declined to comment, citing a policy of not confirming or denying investigations.The inquiry does not mean charges will be filed.This spring and summer, media reports exposed allegedly coercive tactics and inadequate maintenance in multifamily housing developments run by Westminster Management or related entities.An affiliate of Kushner Companies, Westminster manages about 17 properties in Maryland, including developments in Baltimore, Middle River and Essex, according to its website.Kushner Companies has been under the microscope since President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, entered the political scene first as Trump's confidant during the 2016 campaign and now as a senior White House adviser.A Kushner financial disclosure form shows income of $1.6 million from Westminster.A White House spokesman declined to comment.Kushner, married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, stepped down as CEO of his family's namesake business in January and recused himself from certain policy issues since joining the White House.But those measures haven't fully shielded the company from allegations of conflicts of interest and criticism from political foes of the administration as well as more scrutiny from the press.In May, The New York Times and ProPublica detailed "poor upkeep" inside developments run by Westminster, including appliance failures, mold and mouse infestations.The report also documented unsavory debt collection tactics.In addition, The Baltimore Sun reported that Kushner-affiliated businesses were "the most aggressive in Maryland" in seeking civil arrests of tenants who owed the company money.Kushner Companies defended its methods.Responding to the Sun, the company's chief financial officer said the firm "follows guidelines consistent with industry standards" and state law when it files legal action.Westminster Management, "only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary," said Kushner Companies' CFO Jennifer McLean in a statement to the Sun.Related: Jared Kushner's White House role complicates family business In August, Democratic lawmakers cited the stories in a letter to Kushner Companies, requesting answers to questions on matters including alleged housing code violations and federal subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.They were seeking a response by September 8."If these reports are accurate, they raise very serious and troubling concerns about whether Kushner Companies and its subsidiaries are complying with HUD's housing quality standards to ensure the safety and health of their own tenants," wrote the lawmakers, who included Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee.In response, Kushner Companies issued a public statement reiterating that the company exercises its "legal rights under the relevant provisions of the Maryland law."But Kushner Companies did not provide specific answers or produce documents, according to Cummings, who wrote a letter last week asking oversight committee chairman, Republican Trey Gowdy, for help.In the letter to Gowdy, Cummings said his staff called Kushner Companies six times and were told "no information would be provided."In a separate matter, Frosh and the attorney general of the District of Columbia are suing Trump, alleging that his business interests violate the Constitution.The attorneys general are asking a court to block Trump from accepting foreign money.
Roy Moore doesn't say if he'd vote to oust McConnell:::::Story highlights Moore's primary campaign drew significantly on a pledge to take down McConnell A visit to Washington saw the controversial former judge demur on that promise Tuesday Washington (CNN) Fresh off a lunch in the Capitol with his potential colleagues, Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore would not say if he would vote against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, following a primary campaign where his opposition to McConnell was a central focus.Moore spent Tuesday in Washington as he heads to a general election in the heavily Republican state this December, and as he left the Senate GOP lunch, he responded to a few questions from reporters and said he had spoken with McConnell at the event.Asked if he wanted McConnell removed as majority leader, Moore said, "We didn't talk about that.""I'm not going to give you an opinion on that right now," Moore said.The relatively demure approach from Moore on Tuesday came in sharp contrast to his record in Alabama and rhetoric on the campaign trail, where the former judge -- who has a history of incendiary and derogatory comments, including saying homosexuality should be outlawed and that Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim member of Congress, should be barred from serving because of his religion -- railed against McConnell and the Republican establishment as ineffective.Read More

John Kelly Makes Controversial Comments on Civil War:::::More videos (1 of 9) Link to this video UP NEXT White House chief of staff John Kelly made some controversial comments about the Civil War during a recent interview with Fox News.
Kelly's Civil War Comments Blasted as 'Absurd' and 'Dangerous':::::White House chief of staff John Kelly made some controversial comments about the Civil War during a recent interview with Fox News.White House chief of staff John Kelly's comments on the Civil War have prompted an uproar among prominent figures such as Ta-Nehisi Coates and Bernice King, as well as Civil War historians, who say that Kellys comments are dangerous and not based on historical evidence.The outcry came after Kellys response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who asked him about a Virginia churchs decision to remove plaques honoring President George Washington and Confederate General Robert E. Lee."I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country," Kelly, who is from Boston, said."It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now it's different today," he said."But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand."Many historians specializing in Civil War research refuted Kellys claims.Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, told NBC that compromise was actually attempted several times before the Civil War.While he didnt expect Kelly to be an expert in American history, he did expect a better understanding of history from someone who attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Foner said.The Missouri Compromise of 1820 allowed Missouri into the Union as a slave state as long as Maine entered as a free state.The Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but at the same time said Northerners were obligated to help return fugitive slaves to their owners.The Three-Fifths Compromise written into the Constitution counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for congressional districting purposes.Its not that nobody compromised, but that the issues were uncompromisable in the end, having to do with the future of slavery, Foner said.Foner said it was understandable to want to speculate about what might have avoided a bloody war.But the fact is that slavery was also a horrific thing, he said.War is a terrible thing, but sometimes war has positive consequences and this is one of those instances.Other historians said that Kelly, as a White House official, should be held to a higher standard.Joseph Glatthart, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said he found it "deeply disturbing that a retired four-star general does not know the cause of the war that claimed the most American lives in our nations history."Another professor, David Blight of Yale University, agreed that the comments, coming from Kelly, were surprising.He called Kellys remarks sad and absurd and said his perspective was outdated, rooted in a 1950s view of the war that has been significantly altered by modern studies.People who are ignorant in high places are ignorant by choice, Blight told NBC.It is, in effect, to deny and denigrate what hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers died for.Kelly's words were harmful and dangerous because they portray both sides as being in the right, he said."Its not unlike what Trump said about the monuments issue and the protests in Charlottesville," he said."If both sides were right in the Civil War, then why did it happen?"Kelly's comments have been compared to the Lost Cause movement, an intellectual theory that describes both sides as fighting for honorable reasons.The view was that the Confederacy was dedicated to the heroic cause of preserving a certain way of life and fighting for local rights while the North was fighting to preserve the Union.Critics say it minimizes the role of slavery in the Civil War."Historically speaking, the elimination of slavery from its role as the fundamental cause of the Civil War went along with a justification of the racial system of the south in the Jim Crow era," Foner said.Kevin M. Levin, an historian and educator based in Boston, said it struck him that in Kelly's comments about the Civil War, he did not mention the word slavery.Kelly's failure to acknowledge the centrality of slavery to most of the pre-war compromises makes it impossible to understand why the Civil War occurred, Levin told NBC in an email.It also obscures the outcome of the war in 1865 and the end of slavery for four million people.Senator and former vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said Tuesday that he strongly disagreed with Kelly's comments.The Civil War wasnt because of a lack of compromise, Kaine of Virginia said on MSNBC.The Civil War was because of an immoral compromise.He said the war was about a nation that put a Constitution in place that enshrined the institution of slavery and said that a slave is equal to three-fifths of a person.Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C., said Kelly needs a history lesson.The Civil War was not a disagreement between men and women of good faith on both sides, Richmond said in a statement.It was a struggle for the soul of this country.Thankfully, the right side won the war and slavery is no longer the law of the land.Richmond said that the caucus is not surprised by the White Houses repeated attempts to whitewash history and that Kelly is starting to sound a lot like his boss.Bernice King, the daughter of Rev.Martin Luther King Jr., said on Twitter that its irresponsible and dangerous, especially when white supremacists feel emboldened, to make fighting to maintain slavery sound courageous.Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates responded to Kellys claims in a series of Tweets.[The] notion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from America's founding, he said, adding: It's called The Three-Fifths compromise for a reason.But it doesn't stand alone.Missouri Compromise.Kansas-Nebraska Act.Coates said that Lincoln's own platform was a compromise.Lincoln was not an abolitionist, he said.He proposed to limit slavery's expansion, not end it.When asked about Kelly's comments during the White House press briefing Tuesday, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's chief of staff.She said that many historians believe that if some people had been able to compromise in ways she did not specify, the war might not have occurred, an idea expressed by late historian Shelby Foote in the 1990 Ken Burns documentary "The Civil War."It was because we failed to do the thing we really have a genius for, which was compromise, Foote said.Americans like to think of themselves as uncompromising.Our true genius is for compromise.Our whole government's founded on it.And it failed.Burns himself tweeted on Tuesday: Many factors contributed to the Civil War.One caused it: slavery.Sanders criticized the media for pushing to create something that doesnt exist and for portraying the White House as racially charged and divided.General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isnt perfect doesnt mean that its not our history, Sanders said.

Auto Industry Declares War on Trump Over NAFTA:::::FILE - President Donald Trump tours the American Center of Mobility, March 15, 2017, in Ypsilanti Township, Mich. From left are EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, Michigan Gov.Rick Snyder, GM CEO Mary Barra, Trump, Ford CEO Mark Fields, and Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.The U.S. automotive industry has largely embraced the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement since it went into effect Jan. 1, 1994, which may explain why auto and parts makers have become some of the fiercest and most vocal opponents of the Trump administrations plan to renegotiate, or even demolish, NAFTA.As NBC News reported, then-candidate Donald Trump turned American manufacturing jobs into a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and even attacked Ford over its plans to shift production of small passenger cars, such as the Focus, from the U.S. to Mexico.Early on, the auto industry took a cautious approach, attempting to highlight the benefits of the three-nation pact, while trying not to directly challenge the new president.But over the past several months, as the trade talks have generated more friction than results, and as Trump has weighed in by threatening to scuttle NAFTA entirely, the auto industry has begun to raise its collective voice, creating a growing rift with the White House.

Trump's Approval Rating Sinks to New Low: Poll:::::A rare visit to Capitol Hill by President Donald Trump was overshadowed Tuesday by criticism of the president from two Republican senators.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017) President Donald Trumps job approval rating has sunk to the lowest point of his presidency, and nearly half of voters want their vote in the 2018 midterms to be a message for more Democrats in Congress to check Trump and congressional Republicans, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.Thirty eight percent of Americans say they approve of Trumps job performance down five points since September while 58 percent disapprove, NBC News reported.Trumps previous low in approval in the national NBC/WSJ poll was 39 percent back in May."This is his worst showing of his young presidency so far," Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his team at Public Opinion Strategies, told NBC News.

The Note: How will Trump meet terror in his hometown - uniter or divider?:::::The TAKE with Rick Klein Interested in The Note?Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest It happened here in President Trump's hometown, and under circumstances that would seem to confirm his worldview.How Trump handles the deadly terror attack in New York becomes an intriguing test case for the president, who has had some of his best and some of his not-so-great moments in responding to moments of national tragedy.It provides a rare moment of political quiet for Trump to operate in, a chance to unite rather than divide.The Mueller investigation, the tax rollout it all seems small at this moment, though moments like this tend to fade fast.Early indications suggest a return to campaign-era Trump, division or not.He claimed with no details to have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to "step up our already Extreme Vetting Program," a political response coupled with a claim that he won't be "politically correct."(Remember what laws and policies Trump wanted to change in the wake of the shooting in Las Vegas, just a month ago?Hint: "It would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all the facts or what took place last night," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the day after that tragedy.)Trump went all caps in responding to the Manhattan incident that he immediately labeled terrorism: "NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"Nobody wants terrorism on these shores, of course.But even that tweet is a loaded sentence loaded with a campaign full of polarizing promises and nine months' worth of policy pushes.The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks After promising to finally release a real-life tax reform bill today, Republicans late last night whiffed and changed their plans.Now they say, the public may see a version tomorrow.In a statement released just before 10 p.m., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed his team met late into the night."We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our committee beginning next week," the statement by Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, read.But the clock is ticking.The president has said for months that he wants a legislative win on taxes wrapped up by the end of the year.It was always a radical and rather unrealistic timeline for such an ambitious plan that will arguably impact every American and every American business.Still, the late-night punt was surprising given the fact that just hours before, House Speaker Paul Ryan emerged from a meeting with the president at the White House sounding confident in the status of the legislation.The remaining sticking points largely center on how to pay for the expensive wish list.The White House and plenty of rank-and-file Republicans have expressed opposition to lowering the caps on 401K pre-tax contributions, for example, as a possible way to bring in some cash and offset the other changes they want to make in the tax code.The idea of scrapping state and local tax deductions to make up some revenue is also controversial.But in the end something will have to give.The TIP with Veronica Stracqualursi The president's eldest son marked Halloween with a joke that he would take away his

New documents outline why Manafort, Gates were feared as flight risks:::::Newly disclosed documents filed in the case against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates lay out the government's reasons for treating the indicted men as flight risks.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Manafort and Gates, both men of substantial wealth and with considerable foreign contacts, are facing 188 and 151 months in prison, respectively, according to the federal sentencing guidelines described by prosecutors.The Special Counsel's Office argued, "The possibility of prison sentences in these ranges alone establishes a risk of flight as to both defendants."Federal Magistrate Deborah Robinson agreed, ordering that both surrender their passports and be placed on house arrest.The government also asserts in the filings that both men "lied repeatedly to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants, legal counsel, and the government to further their scheme."Some of those lies, the government alleges, had to do with filings required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) that Manafort and Gates submitted in November 2016 and February 2017 with the help of an attorney."The Chief Judge recently found that the government made a prima facie showing the defendants used their former attorney (who was not complicit) to convey this false and misleading information to the Department of Justice," the Special Counsels Office (SCO) states in its conditions of release memo.The new filings also disclose that Chief Judge Beryl Howell ordered the attorney to testify before the grand jury, effectively pushing aside the attorney-client privilege.Dana Verkouteren via AP "When a person uses the attorney-client relationship to further a criminal scheme, the law is well established that a claim of attorney-client or work-product privilege must yield to the grand jury's investigatory needs," Howell wrote in his memorandum opinion."The Court finds that the SCO has made a sufficient prima facie showing that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client and work-product privileges applies," Howell added.To some legal observers, this is another sign that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is playing hardball."They are sending a signal of being aggressive," said former federal prosecutor and ABC News consultant Matt Olsen."This is an indication that the investigation is going to turn over every stone and is not going to let any so-called claim of privilege get in the way of finding out the truth," Olsen added."Attorney client privilege is not a shield to protect ongoing criminal wrongdoing."
Bannon advised Trump to be more aggressive in slowing down Mueller investigation: Sources:::::President Donald Trump's former political strategist advised him in a phone call on Monday to be more aggressive about slowing down special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trumps campaign colluded with the Russians, according to three sources close to Bannon.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Bannon has been advocating for "a much more aggressive legal approach short of firing Mueller," a source close to Bannon told ABC News on Monday.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said at todays press briefing that the president does not support defunding of the special counsel.She also added that hes happy with his legal team.Im not sure what we would push back against since theyve just come up with ways and shown more and more that theres no connection between the Trump campaign and collusion with Russia, Sanders said.ABC News reached out to Bannon, who declined to comment.The Breitbart founder and firebrand conservative also previously suggested that Trump should consider replacing his legal team, sources told ABC News.Bannon has encouraged the president to demand that the Justice Department require more accountability for the resources spent on the investigation, the sources told ABC News on Monday.Bannon has been an advisor for Trump since he joined the campaign in August 2016.Even though he was forced to resign from the administration in August 2017, he has been a frequent advisor to Trump, whom he often speaks to by phone.A controversial figure in the White House, Bannon has been an advocate for the travel ban, for example.He has openly disagreed with the presidents decision to fire former FBI director James Comey, calling it the biggest political mistake in modern history in a recent interview.Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 to oversee the investigation into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.Two people were indicted on Monday -- former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former campaign official Rick Gates.Former campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos has been charged with making false statements to the FBI.Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trumps personal legal team, told George Stephanopoulos on This Week, on Sunday: The president has authority to take action.Trump has taken to Twitter to openly question the validity of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, repeatedly calling it a "witch hunt."Trump reportedly asked for legal advice about the possibility of firing Mueller.However, Sekulow pushed back against this possibility on Good Morning America on Tuesday, telling Stephanopoulos, There is no conversation regarding firing Robert Mueller.And there's no basis to fire Robert Mueller on anything that weve seen.You could only terminate a special counsel for cause, and we just dont see any basis for cause, Sekulow added.Shortly after Mueller was first appointed, Trumps allies outside of the White House and in the press launched a campaign against Mueller, questioning whether he has a partisan bias.Conservative pundit Ann Coulter called on Trump to fire Mueller and conservative writer Byron York suggested that it would be impossible for Mueller to be fair because of his friendship with Comey.Trump ally and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted: Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair.Bannon has encouraged this campaign against Mueller to continue, according to sources close to Bannon, but has suggested that they use legislation, slow down document production and rally conservatives in the House and Senate to get behind slowing down the investigation.Asked by reporters on Tuesday whether he could be confident that the White House won't pressure Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire special counsel Bob Mueller, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr said, "I can't be confident on anything.Burr also reiterated what he said in a press conference with the committees vice chairman, Mark Warner, two weeks ago: they "have not come to a conclusion" about any Russian collusion with the Trump campaign."It continues to be something that we look at.Its the mission of the investigation, and the vice chairman and I continue to chart a course to answer all the questions," he said.
House Republicans delay tax plan rollout:::::House Republicans are delaying the rollout of their tax bill amid unresolved questions about key elements of the plan.Interested in Taxes?Add Taxes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Taxes news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Republicans were slated to unveil the bill Wednesday, but are now pushing the announcement to Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, confirmed late Tuesday night."In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday," Brady said in a statement."We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week."Just minutes earlier, Brady had emerged from a meeting with Ways and Means Committee Republicans and told reporters staff were planning to "work through the night" on the bill, and that there were no changes to the initial self-imposed timetable.Republicans continue to wrestle with potential changes to state and local tax deductions that would generate revenue to help pay for the tax cuts in the proposal, which could add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years."It's a thousand technical moving parts.We're trying to get them right," Rep. David Schweikert, R-Arizona, a Ways and Means Committee member, said Tuesday night.House and Senate GOP leaders have little room for error to reach consensus on the tax bill, which they hope to pass by Thanksgiving and send to the White House for President Trump's signature by Christmas.The delay raises new questions about Republicans ability to adhere to their ambitious timeline.The last comprehensive tax reform effort, a bipartisan push under President Reagan, took several years from start to finish.
Unanswered questions in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation:::::On Monday, the first charges and first plea in special prosecutor Robert Mueller's Russia investigation were revealed, unearthing accusations of lying to the FBI, conspiracy and money laundering.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Manafort's longtime business associate Rick Gates were indicted in federal court on Friday on charges including conspiracy against the United States, money laundering and working as unregistered foreign agents.Their charges were unsealed Monday morning.Shortly afterwards, the special counsel's office announced that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, pleaded guilty this month to making false statements to FBI agents about his correspondence with Russian nationals and attempts to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian officials.The revelations, which continued to embroil the White House in questions over Russian involvement in the 2016 election, gave great insight into the investigation, but also created a lot of new, unanswered questions.Here are some of the lingering questions that have arisen out of the charged leveled against former Trump associates: Who might be next?Any member of the campaign with connections to the Russians has to potential to be a target of the investigation being led by Mueller.Michael Flynn, for example, remains under intense investigation.This spring, the former national security adviser, invoked theFifth Amendment and rejected the Senate Intelligence Committee's subpoena for documents relating to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Carlos Barria/Reuters, FILE The committee subpoenaed Flynn's personal documents on May 10, after he declined to cooperate with an April 28 request from the panel in relation to its investigation of Russian interference in the election and possible ties to Trump associates.Flynn, one of Trump's earliest campaign supporters, resigned in February amid controversy about a call to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. before the inauguration.It's unclear who else, if anyone, might face charges in the wide-ranging case.One thing the unsealed guilty plea showed, it that false statements -- anyone who was interviewed who wasnt completely truthful with the investigators -- could face charges.Whats next for Manafort and Gates?Manafort and Gates are currently on house arrest and they face up to 20 years in prison.Manafort was released on a $10 million "unsecured appearance bond" and Gates on a $5 million bond.Under the terms of their release, they will be restricted to their homes and can only leave for meetings with their attorneys, court dates, medical appointments, or religious observance.They can't have passports, and must call the U.S.Marshals to check in every day.They are scheduled to appear in court next on Thursday for a status hearing before federal judge Amy Berman Jackson.Susan Walsh/AP, FILE Legal observers believe prosecutors presented strong case and will likely result in guilty plea.However, Manaforts lawyer on Monday called some of the charges "ridiculous" and said there was "no evidence" of the Trump campaign and Manafort colluding with the Russian government.His statements could be pre-trial posturing or a sign that he's fixing for a fight.Gates was represented by a public defender due to the short notice, but is "not eligible for appointed counsel" due to his wealth for the continuation of the case.Glenn Selig, a spokesman for Gates, said that he "welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in court.""This fight is just beginning," said Selig in a statement after the court appearance.Who are the unnamed people in Papadopoulos' guiltily plea?This case opens a window into how Mueller still has so much more to do, and so many more people hes looking at.Although the court documents don't disclose additional names, many associations are revealed.In terms of how many people knew what Papadopoulos was up to with Russia, the statement of facts says he emailed "several members" of Trumps foreign policy staff about it; Papadopoulos told all those at the Trump meeting on March 31 about it; Papadopoulos emailed two "high-ranking campaign officials" about his efforts; he emailed a campaign supervisor" about it; and he emailed a senior policy adviser about an open invitation" from Russia to meet with Trump.ABC News identified Manafort, Corey Lewandowski and Sam Clovis Tuesday as three of the campaign officials who were contacted by Papadopoulos.And as Muellers team told the judge during Papadopoulos plea hearing: "Theres a large-scale ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part."In other words, by Mueller teams own admission, there is still a lot more to come.How did Manafort spend his money?The indictment against Manafort and Gates offers insight into their alleged financial dealings and expenditures.Prosecutors allege that Manafort used hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a "lavish lifestyle" without paying taxes on that income.Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work - hiding Ukraine payments and laundering the money, according to the indictment.He "spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts," reads the indictment.Alex Brandon/AP, FILE Those millions include, approximately $2,850,000 on a condo in New York City that he rented out on Airbnb, and approximately $3,000,000 in cash for a brownstone building in Brooklyn, NY.Manafort used offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the U.S. in order to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it, allege prosecutors.He is also accused of spending $849,215 at a men's clothing store, $655,500 on a landscaper, and $934,350 at an Antique Rug dealer in Virginia, among other expenditures.The Weekly Standard called around the the Alexandria rug dealers, near Manafort's home, and talked to a rug expert that said in order to by a million dollars of rugs in Alexandria, "you'd have to buy an entire shop."ABC News' Pierre Thomas and Mike Levine contributed to this report.
George Papadopoulos emailed powerful Trump campaign figures about Russian contacts:::::Paul Manafort, Corey Lewandowski and Sam Clovis are among the Trump campaign officials who were contacted by George Papadopoulos, the low-level campaign adviser who lied to the FBI about his dealings with suspected Russian agents, sources familiar with the emails have told ABC News.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Documents unsealed by special counsel Robert Mueller on Monday detailing correspondence between Papadopoulos and a group of foreign nationals show that within weeks of being described by Trump as an important part of his national security team, Papadopoulos was in London meeting with people who said they could deliver dirt on rival candidate Hillary Clinton, including thousands of e-mails.One of so-called foreign contacts is identified as a professor who introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian woman who claimed to be Vladimir Putins niece and a Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs official.This is the clearest evidence yet of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told ABC News these latest revelations prove nothing.If indictments were all about Russians reaching to Americans there would be a lot of people who would have been indicted yesterday, Burr said.Alex Brandon/AP Since the documents have been made public, Trump and his team have sought to minimize Papadopoulos role in the campaign, characterizing his involvement as extremely limited.Papadopoulos, however, appears to have had a direct line of contact to some of the campaigns most powerful figures, which he used to discuss the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia.The sources told ABC News that one of the people identified in the Papadopoulos case as a high-ranking official is Paul Manafort, the onetime campaign chairman who forwarded one of Papadopoulos emails to another campaign official, Rick Gates, stating: We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips, referring to a proposed trip to Russia.It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.Lewandowski, the former campaign manager who was identified by the sources as the other high-ranking campaign official, received emails from Papadopoulos on multiple occasions but it is unclear if he responded.Lewandowski did not respond to questions from ABC News but told NBCs Today show that he didnt know if he was one of the unnamed officials in the document.I was receiving thousands of emails a day, he said.Youre asking me to remember an email from April of 2016 when, on any given day, I wouldve received a thousand emails, and this would have come from a low-level volunteer.Evan Vucci/AP, FILE Clovis, however, the campaigns national co-chairman who was identified as a campaign supervisor, responded directly to Papadopoulos, hailing him for his great work and saying I would encourage you to make the trip, if it is feasible.Clovis currently serves as a senior White House adviser to the Department of Agriculture and has a Senate confirmation hearing for his nomination to be an Undersecretary at the Department of Agriculture next week.An attorney for Clovis confirmed his role to ABC News, adding that he has not spoken to Papadopoulos since the 2016 election and any trip he would have taken would not have been authorized by the campaign and would have been done on his own personal time and money.
ANALYSIS: Dems holding their fire in the face of Russia investigation:::::Three minutes into a 14-minute speech Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pivoted from the news of the day to judicial nominations and tax reform, and Democratic political operatives advising the party and candidates around the country breathed a sigh of relief.After months of wrestling with how to talk about the Russia investigations, Democrats now seem to agree they should tread lightly on the topic and that, when it comes to the Russia news, going all in is not a winning strategy.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Just hours before Schumers remarks on the Senate floor, the special counsels office indicted two former Trump campaign officials and unsealed a guilty plea from a former Trump adviser.Despite the seriousness of the news and possible implications for Republicans and the White House, top Democrats on Capitol Hill kept their responses relatively measured.They argued the investigations should go on free from any outside influence and said little else.On last nights Late Night With Seth Meyer, Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., summed up his political calculus.Americans are not staying up every day worrying about Russias interference in our election, he said.Theyre wondering how theyre going to send their kids to college.Theyre worried about how theyre going to be able to pay the rent.A Democratic Party staffer during Barack Obamas presidency told ABC News, It does not matter if there is a picture of Trump shaking Putins hand and saying, Thanks for the emails.We are not going to win in 2018 off the Russia story.We are going to win because [Republicans] are cutting taxes for billionaires while cutting services for the poor and middle class.A week from Election Day in Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam reportedly brushed aside a question about the special counsels announcements, telling a Washington Post reporter, It is certainly unfortunate for this country.Its unfortunate for Virginia.But there a process in place, and I support the process.Justice will be served.He continued, Ive got a week left, and were going to continue to focus on the positive message, the message of jobs, health care and the education.The fact remains too that the scope and direction of the special counsels work is still largely unknown, and early indications suggest Mueller is not looking solely at the GOP.On Monday, Tony Podesta, a top Democrat fundraiser and the brother of Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, stepped down from his namesake lobbying group.The Podesta Group has been the subject of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation as well, because of its work on behalf of foreign interests, specifically dealing with Ukraine.With Trumps approval ratings at an all-time low, Democrats on the Hill feel cautiously optimistic that they are winning messaging battles around policy issues and that any news from Muellers team could do their work for them, perhaps even more effectively if they stay out.Mueller has the investigation in the eyes of everyday people, a Democratic Party operative who advises House candidates told ABC News.[Voters] are going to see much more credibility if it comes from law enforcement than if it becomes politicized.The advisers team has been advising candidates to stick to issues like the economy, health care and jobs, but he added, If [Trump] fires Mueller, you can call me back.
Trump tries to distance himself from George Papadopoulos: 'Few people knew the young, low level volunteer':::::In his first response to George Papadopoulos' guilty plea, President Donald Trump today attempted to distance himself from the foreign policy adviser who joined his 2016 campaign and later served on a presidential international business advisory council.Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar," Trump tweeted this morning.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this month to lying to FBI officials about his communications with Russian nationals in an effort to arrange a meeting between Trump campaign and Russian officials.Special counsel Robert Mueller's team unsealed the documents in the case against Papadopoulos on Monday as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow argued on "Good Morning America" today that Papadopoulos' offense was "no crime of collusion."The Fake News is working overtime.As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he... Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 ....came to the campaign.Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.Check the DEMS!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 Papadopoulos most recently served as an independent oil, gas and policy consultant for the International Presidential Business Advisory Council, according to his LinkedIn account.He was a volunteer for the campaign and his role was "extremely limited," the White House said Monday.Papadopoulos was seated at the table with Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a March 31 meeting with the president's national security team.During a visit to Washington Post headquarters in March last year, Trump revealed the names of his foreign policy team and mentioned Papadopoulos as an "excellent guy."Tom Brenner/The New York Times/Redux White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that Trump was being nothing more than "complimentary on behalf of the campaign" at the time.Trump has argued that the focus of Mueller's investigation should be on Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.Along with Papadopoulos' guilty plea, Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign manager Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts, including money laundering and failing to disclose work as foreign agents.They pleaded not guilty."As Paul [Manafort's] lawyer said, there was 'no collusion' and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign," Trump tweeted.The indictment released by the special counsel on Monday alleges that Manafort acted as an unregistered agent of the Ukrainian government from 2006 to 2015.According to the document, he was laundering Ukrainian payments from 2006 through at least 2016 to hide them from the U.S. government.He joined the Trump campaign in March 2016.
Trump chief of staff John Kelly calls Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee an 'honorable man':::::White House chief of staff John Kelly on Monday called Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man" and suggested that a lack of compromise led to the Civil War.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man, Kelly said in an interview on Fox News on Monday evening.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now its different today.But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.John Kelly on immigration: "If we can't verify, I don't think we should let them into the country."#IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/Zo4M4RWxuX Fox News (@FoxNews) October 31, 2017 Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, did not elaborate on how the Civil War could have been prevented through compromise.His comments echoed those of President Donald Trump, who has pushed back against the removal of Confederate monuments, including those honoring Lee.This week it's Robert E. Lee.I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down.I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?Trump said in a August.That statement came in the wake of an outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia which began in protest of the planned removal of a Lee monument that left one person dead and 19 others injured after a car ramming.Police arrested James Alex Fields, 20, and charged him with second-degree murder in the attack.Major cities and institutions across the country have opted to remove or relocate Confederate statues this year, with many calling them symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.In August the University of Texas at Austin, for example, said it would remove statues of Lee and three other Confederate generals because they were erected during the period of segregation and represent the subjugation of African-Americans.
Facebook to tell Congress Russian-linked content may have reached 126 million during 2016 election:::::Facebook, one of the worlds largest social media networks, will reveal for the first time on Tuesday that Russian-linked content may have reached as many as 126 million people across the platform during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Facebooks general counsel Colin Stretch is expected to reveal the finding during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been investigating Russian meddling in the election, according to draft testimony obtained by ABC News.The company has been under intensifying pressure from Congress to be more transparent about political activities conducted on the online network.Stretch is expected to say that an internal Facebook audit discovered that the fake accounts linked to a Russian company produced 80,000 posts between 2015 and 2017.Those posts appeared on the news feeds of 29 million users but may have reached as many as 126 million people because of user activity on the site.The finding sheds new light on the scale of Russias effort to spread divisive propaganda online during the 2016 presidential race.In September, Facebook revealed that it had sold more than $100,000 in political ads to the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg, which produced roughly 3,000 political ads.Stretch will tell Congress that approximately 11.4 million people saw at least one of those Russian-linked political ads, according to the draft testimony obtained by ABC News.The ads promoted fake Facebook pages, which produced the 80,000 pieces of content between January 2015 and August 2017.The 80,000 posts made up roughly 1-in-23,000 pieces of content on the site during that period of time.Though the volume of these stories was a tiny fraction of the overall content on Facebook, any amount is too much, Stretch is expected to tell the Senate panel.Those accounts and Pages violated Facebooks policies -- which is why we removed them, as we do with all fake or malicious activity we find.Facebook is planning to turn the posts over to the three congressional committees investigating Russian election interference, along with special counsel Robert Muellers team.While Facebook and Twitter have taken new steps in recent days to self-police and address concerns, some are pushing legislation to increase transparency across the entire industry.I think the American people deserve a full accounting both of not only what happened in 2016, but what these platforms are doing to close these vulnerabilities going forward, Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, told ABC News.This activity didn't stop on November 8th.Less is known about the role fake Twitter accounts may have played in the 2016 election.Twitter took the unusual step last week of banning Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik from advertising on the site after finding both had used Twitter ads in an attempt to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.Like Facebook, Rosenberger said Twitter plays an important role in shaping the political conversation in the country.I mean certainly there's no doubt that the president of the United States believes that Twitter is a very important platform for communication, she said.So I think that if he thinks it's an important platform I think certainly the Russians believe it's an important platform.Twitter has uncovered a total of 2,752 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency -- more than 10 times the number of accounts initially disclosed to Congress -- and has identified the accounts for congressional investigators, according to a source familiar with the company's testimony Tuesday.Advance testimony obtained by ABC News shows Twitter will emphasize the limited amount of Russian activity on the platform."Its important to place those numbers in scale: the 36,746 automated accounts that we identified as Russian-linked and tweeting election-related content represent approximately 1/100th of a percent [0.012%] of the total accounts on Twitter at the time," Twitter's representative is expected to testify Tuesday.Google, in a blog post Monday evening ahead of this week's hearings, revealed the results of its own internal investigation into Russian use of the platform.According to the audit, two accounts linked to the Russian troll farm spent $4,700 on ads on Google platforms.The company also identified 18 YouTube channels linked to the Russian influence campaign.The channels had a combined 1,108 videos uploaded -- a total of 43 hours of content that accumulated 309,000 U.S. views from June 2015 to November 2016.Google also found "evidence that Gmail accounts associated with the campaign were used to open accounts on other platforms" and has shared that information with other platforms.Tuesdays hearing is one of three scheduled this week on Russian use of social media.On Wednesday, Facebook, Twitter and Google will also testify before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.
New Va. attack ad shows minority children chased by truck with Gillespie sticker, Confederate flag:::::The Virginia gubernatorial election is now officially a week away, and a new ad from a Democratic group in the state is again sparking a bitter war of words between the two campaigns vying for the Commonwealths top office.The minute-long ad -- entitled "American Nightmare" -- from the Latino Victory Project features a pickup truck adorned with a Confederate flag and an Ed Gillespie bumper sticker driving aggressively through the neighborhood chasing young minority children fleeing in terror.Latino Victory Project/YouTube The ad drew swift condemnation from both the Republican National Committee -- which said it showed Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam's campaign was in "total panic mode" -- and the Gillespie campaign."Ed Gillespie has focused his campaign on the many policy differences between Ralph Northam and him, but sadly the Northam campaign and its allies have launched a desperate smear campaign against Ed in the closing days of this election," Gillespie campaign manager Chris Leavitt wrote in a statement."The lieutenant governor was roundly rebuked for exploiting imagery from the tragedy of Charlottesville for political points.Now his allies have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery.This is not an attack on Ed Gillespie anymore.This is an all-out attack on the people of Virginia.This latest ad gives a clear indication of just what Ralph Northam and his national Democratic allies think of all of us, and its sickening," the statement continued.The Northam campaign defended the ad and accused Gillespie of being the candidate attempting to sew division in the race.Washington Post via AP, FILE "Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history.It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them," Northam's press secretary Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement.Gillespie, the former chairman of the RNC, has taken steady heat over his controversial ads highlighting the threat of the MS-13 gang in Virginia, as well as ads accusing Northam of supporting policies that allow sex offenders to have their gun rights restored.The Northam campaign responded to Gillespie's attacks, releasing an ad late last week saying Gillespie's charges are "false."Recent polls have shown Northam with a widening lead as the campaign heads into its final week, but most observers believe that the race will likely remain tight.The race is the only competitive gubernatorial race in the country this year, and it is considered an early barometer of how the Trump presidency will factor into the 2018 midterm elections.

Senators Warner and Klobuchar created a fake ad to show how easy it is Video:::::Transcript for Senators Warner and Klobuchar created a fake ad to show how easy it is Amy I decided that it was a saint.Should we go out and create.A fake organization.And then put an ad out that would.Get this add to keep people in Washington so Amy spent twenty dollars but he had disbanded to try to get to key hill staffers.I spent twenty dollars trying to get to key.Media and individuals.So you're treating your own phony political group and then targeting it.To a specific to show how easy it is not there at Q&A thanks to your treating your own phony political group and then targeting it to very specific.And we kids exactly what a lot of these groups were doing and we are showing that despite policies.Upgrades it's still going.So for twenty dollars I was able to reach over 14100.Journalist.Right here in Washington DC with this ad that talks about a group it's.Supposedly in favor of disclosure.Twenty dollars yet we had over 14100 impressions.And were able to have reached hundreds of senate staffers to.Think keep people that are working on.This issue and that is exactly the kind of thing that cause and by the way if political groups wanted to do this kind of thing than they should have.We did put a disclaimer on ours but as you know that they don't have to and they also don't have to dispose he had imagine if ads like these were kept on a file public found on the Internet so journalists could then check them out to make each other real and who's paying for.An accompanying her instead they're gonna put in place new practices you're saying even if that's an off the playing field and puts you might have occasional companies doing it.But what was say those companies couldn't reverse course if they change management.What would happen if certain companies and FaceBook or Twitter moved to better practices but then.The porn actors decide to use other platforms.And Americans need to know.The source of the political ads whether it's American or foreign.We ought to be able as go look at the content it's being used foreign against candidates.And this really ghosts of the heart of protecting our democracy what we've seen so far.Is it for a little bit of money then with some paid actors.And some organized box you can drive a story into almost any main stream.Media in a way there's we've seen for example with FaceBook touched a 127.Million Americans.Had that was just individual Americans touched by these Russian propaganda and misinformation efforts.We all regardless of what party we go to ought to be concerned about that I'm going forward basis because none of this ended on Election Day.You've seen some of these there's been a lot of congress is not micro targeting.What kinds of divisions did they seek to exploit how did these troll farms beef nefarious actors try to really target these.Two different audience.Well in some ways these companies which are brilliant companies in America or proud of well what they did was they gave them the tools to do this and we know they went after certain people in certain states and certain districts.Certain demographics.But we don't know a lot because some of these ads are just vanished and that is why.If you just put the same rules in place than we would be able to see in campaigns would be able to see what these ads are.You know in every ad I have to San meaning Klobuchar approve this message and so does my account and so we just wanna have that information out there.Because the last time I checked our whole country was set up.Though it be self governing.We didn't want to have other countries influencing our democracy we want to have the freedom to make our own decisions about who we voted for and went you have.Actual evidence that ads are being bought in rubles and other countries are trying to intervene you gotta do something about it in these companies are gonna have to step forward and take responsibility.And what we've seen for example and Texas there was a group that was a very kind of pro nationalistic.Pro Texas group.There was a similar group that was focused on Muslims who lived in Texas had and they.Adds tried to get both groups to show up at the same place.With counter demonstrations.Mean we saw what kind of activity though.Horrific actions it took place in Charlottesville.Earlier this year and saying that was spurred by Russian activity but the notion that these.Companies are using Russian generated top content that's spewing hatred and trying to exacerbate.Divisions where we've already got too many divisions in our country.I really hope that they will step up.These companies and say hey they wanna work wits are Klobuchar mines are McCain and others as broadly bipartisan.And say had a we make sure we just get a little more disclosure we just do this in the interest of our national security my hope is that they will work with us.When he is one more example of that and you'll see at the hearing.Is an ad an African American woman and the ads said stay home.You don't have to go vote you can vote from home and taxis five numbers.And clearly at that with a lot you couldn't vote that way and we have no idea how many people cook that is real because it actually had.A disclaimer from the Clinton Campaign which of course was false.And some of them had pictures that the candidate.And not air their faith and not to give you don't need more examples of just there was.One Twitter account that was called ten GOP party.Representing us up to be the Tennessee Republican Party in at a 154000.Followers.The real Tennessee Republican Party has got about thirteen thousand followers.And people say well people spot.If these ads if their fate well this ten Republican ten GOP party.Was re tweeted some of their awful comments.By Kellyanne Conway by Donald Trump junior by senior officials and trump campaign I don't believe that you.Knew that this was Russian sponsored in what is particularly.Disturbing as it literally took until.Just a week or so before Twitter took down this obviously fake account even though the real Tennessee Republican Party had been asking to take it down for months.Just because the process seems to be so commerce them.Have you seen and mean.Evidence of any kind of link between these

Trump downplays special counsel's probe, tries to shift focus to taxes Video:::::Transcript for Trump downplays special counsel's probe, tries to shift focus to taxes Happy Tuesday and welcome to the.The briefing room coming to the Washington bureau of ABC news on jobs and teaching belong site White House correspondent Tara pol Mary.And our justice reporter Mike Levine guys could be with you.Crazy briefing after a crazy Monday in Washington of course indictment Monday it was yesterday and today that he's still a focus.In the briefing like it to that was there are right now Michael let's start with you this was.It's coming.Didn't know who it was going to be you know who was gonna play but still a lot of questions from this White House as to who could be next and camping news.Up now Russia trying get involved in election.There's there's.Going to say it does that make a deal that in her mind that this is good and soon it's worth noting two things first.How many people George pop it up with in his plea deal yesterday that really get laid out there it's.Not according to DOJ several officials that he looped in on his efforts to set up meetings between trump associates.And Russian officials are there are two high ranking campaign officials a senior policy official.And there is a another official that he emails and says hey.Russia is there is an open invitation from Russia for a meeting between trump and to.Sarah also said that one of the reasons she's so confident this is gonna wrap up soon because the facts are on her side.For someone like Mueller he takes a long time to get the facts and and we should make clear there is no time fuel.For how this could wrap it definitely does not seem to us anyway and it for this year.You know there's.I would be shocked.Well but I don't encounter all of Eric but what you.Yours.Who.Here and the structure is now with going to be analyzed as to who weren't these top level official.If George puppet operatives actually.Touch way.Right now I can't that this the game for approval this act on junior for Greenland house Q with the campaign manager at the time.The other issue is now we're seeing some people that are you know nominated to be a part of the administration.Being caught up in school group of foreign policy advisors were keen on making connections with Russia likes and Clovis and he's up for nomination in the Department of Agriculture.What does this mean for his nomination and Sarah theater seems to think he can go along with it even now an affidavit.Shows that he sent go for it don't want Patrick to Russia.Good work is right.Where were great job Michoacan act.Now you know I want to question here is brought in his part of what's happening this investigation is collusion right that's been the question everyone's financed.Economists or lawyers but no one case you are ABC news contributors on the phone he KII know you've been watching this with all abuzz over the last 24 hours.Collusion is that word it's been thrown out a lot.Break that down for us what exactly.Justify exclusion is there such a charge as collusion.Yet you know it's an important question is the word we are hearing all the time but it actually isn't a specific federal crime right.Under it in the context of antitrust actually not generally.It was sort of a self fulfilling prophecy to say that you know there's been no collusion no intent on collusion because it's just not specific federal and it's kind of it's being used broadly.To describe you know conspiracy in need to Indian wire fraud and computer fraud and interfering with election there's lots of sort of specific federal crimes I think.I'm you know taken together can be generally understood it.As constituting collusion.But I think that's part of what's.Hard to get your arms around it's not actually specific offense with specific element.Kate just hang with us where it come back to you our chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl ease outside John.You asked that question comes to our standards.That was asked the general Keller yesterday.Is this investigation a distraction.For the president and the White House and it is he really not been getting work done kinda weird response for her there.Well it was because Kelly on that interview with Laura Ingraham Fox News at this is very very big distraction the president.So I said is that such a big distraction is getting in the way of getting as worked on in she said no he's you know the world distracted.You're out here priced land but.But but that he's focused on getting as worked on I did think that was there was an actually slightly.Different message that we heard.From from Cali but it's well that you hear.Any senior administration official or spokesperson of any kind for a White House.It knowledge that the president is very distracted under any circumstances.You know laser focus that's the first annual always say that he is right now aiming on tax reform and and let's move on to their for a second because the president.It was asked.A little bit today about the Russian story he didn't engage Jon but he talked a little bit about what he's hoping for holidays let's take a reckless and that.I want the house to pass a bill by Thanksgiving I want all of the people standing by my side.When we get ready designed by Christmas hopefully before Christmas you'll be in the room standing in front row center I think we'll be able to find a place we can all stand for senator.We have big event it'll be the biggest accident of history book.So John.Merry Christmas or even be standing in the courtroom when this happens.If it happens John will be there with in the front row will be in the middle Monroe.I can promise you that.But I you know this is incredibly ambitious on line tax reform.Not simply passing tax cuts tax reform.Which involves.Not simply cutting rates but changing.That the that the tax system.Is something that has been done before not very often before and it's usually been a process that has lasted.Many months if not years.So to get this stone.We've been weeks.A deal being introduced.And means to the point of being signed.By the unity it would be incredibly.And vicious incredibly quick but I will tell you that it.It's not clear that it's any easier.To do it on a long time frame that it would be that ram it through.The feeling among the Republicans leading the effort on Capitol Hill on this is that by going fast.You give the opposition all those opposition groups to come out to fight little.Bits or pieces of what's being changed give them less time to build up.Their forces.You basically.Ram this through because your best chance of getting it on is getting it done quickly.Jon Karl we're now like Hugo thank you for playing as always terror pulmonary and bring it back here into the bureau because.You taxable that they mean it needs a legislative here.Home on display.Yet at all in fact my sources close the presidency doesn't really know that much about and he has you know wide.Great brush strokes not what's in Pakistan that he saw trying to figure out what to do with Lee local and state tax deductions that trumpets not someone who likes to into the weeds of policy he's a salesman or a marketer and has been his career in real estate.In modeling and in branding essentially so he's testing and a hat and ran his spell and he's.He's coming up with phrases but he's not really coming up with a solution quite yet some might say that's for the congress and at the senate to deal because they're the went to essentially passed the bill but they are looking for some some guidance from the White House and I know that from my sources at in the White House that they're working on those solutions that they can get.Republicans Blue States like New Jersey.New York California on board because they don't want it local and state act tax check.And we should note that the president actually has secretary of the treasury Stephen inching Gary Cohen actually seeing backed off that trip we also just learned.That a bunker trump is in the polling hurt puppy part of the trip short.It's not going to be going for it is going to be coming back here to work on tax reform just joining us is the briefing Germany BC I'm Jones and Tucci.Los I terror pulmonary and Michael Levine I do want to switch gears though because a comment yesterday.Made by general John Killian a rare interviews the prequel would abuzz today with this Italy's than.Summing Serra ideal in the briefing he was asked about.Statues.Around the country of that big controversies frowning Charlottesville.Over the summer when stature property Lee was taking down.He's calm and sun generally.Getting bit of attention take a listen this from last night.No 500 years later.It's inconceivable to me that you would take what we've we think now replied America I think it's just very very dangerous in that it shows you what.How much of of a lack of appreciation of history what history is.Would that of Robert.And here's a man that gave up gave up his country.To fight for his state which in 150 years ago was more important than country it was always loyalty to stage first back in those days.Now words different today.But did the deed the lack of an ability to compromise.Led to the civil war.It and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand with their conscience.Have to make it Stan.So that right here on the question of compromise terror that was an inning guy Sarah Anderson a little bit and we were bowl watching little that murky whether they're.Attacked it hats he.And asked her style are you comparing me to Washington JFK other American heroes.This is only it really difficult answer bored the you know White House just keeps stepping.Down inciting.You know racial controversy and it they don't have a great track record on that so aren't specimen their response to Charlotte now.I didn't and the NFL I mean there're so many examples here where this is kinda snowballed leave them kind of like a moment here it was her regularly going.Yet it was that she doesn't mean I I I don't want to read litigate the civil war I mean that's not real Clara fire what general Kelley needs that she said that it's been litigated and had just appointed.They don't have a really answer to that they really should.Instead of coming out this is the it date they can't handle on things and after the issue became all the questions that follow up forever and.You know as we get ready to go through this week that you guys acutely Tuesday if I almost said good morning it's Thursday that didn't work but you know what to look for this week and Mike let's start with you because you.He

nothing to with collusion.What happened yesterday we don't know what's going to happen in terms of collusion right.Now metaphor and gates are under pressure that they weren't under just three days ago

White House says special counsel's probe will wrap in 'short time,' media is 'obsessed' Video:::::Transcript for White House says special counsel's probe will wrap in 'short time,' media is 'obsessed' Staff John Kelly says it is counts compliment he's been very distracting the president.You elaborate on what basis passes.Affecting his ability his job done.I don't think it's at all affecting his ability is job done and that was the point he was making.You guys sing completely obsessed with this while there are a lot of other things happening around the country and frankly a lot of other things that people care a lot more about.The media refuses to cover it I think that's the distraction instead of the focus being constantly on tax cuts and tax reform.My quest is if you look at the records the questions that I'd taken here day out.Have far more to do with an investigation.That frankly most Americans don't care too much about in a whole lot less to do with policies that actually impact them.These as the usual won't.Because we we have confidence that it's gonna come to a close and short time.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Legal implications of Russia investigation, 1st charges Video:::::Transcript for Legal implications of Russia investigation, 1st charges All right, so let's bring in our chief legal analyst, Dan Abrams.You were listening ink tently.What jumped out.So it's important to remember what's significant here and what's not significant here.It's not that significant at this point exactly what papadopoulos did, even what manafort or Gates did in the context of the big picture question of was there collusion?What do I mean by that?The key question, what did the trump campaign officials do?Every time a question is asked about, well, what did the campaign officials do, the answer is, well, this is what papadopoulos has been -- this is what he's pleading to or this is what manafort is charged with.Those are important and, but they don't go to the ultimate question of what did the campaign officials do?What did they say in response, et cetera, and that's what you have to be focusing on.Manafort and gaetsdz pleaded not guilty.Does this mean they're not cooperating with the investigation.It means they're not cooperating enough.If they are cooperating they did cooperate they're certainly going to cooperate now.If they did cooperate at any point, we don't know but they certainly didn't cooperate enough to get a plea deal.Let's tie the two things together.One of the things we know from the papadopoulos agreement we believe the high campaign officials he was in contact with include Paul manafort and likely Rick Gates as well so if you tie together the idea that he may have information on them with the indictments of manafort and Gates, it's another way to get more pressure on them to cooperate going forward That's right.But it is fair for the administration to say that the manafort and Gates indictments don't relate to Russia and they don't relate to trump meaning they're about money.I shouldn't say they don't relate to Russia.They don't relate to the trump campaign because they're about things that happened before then.The question when you look at the big picture is a separate issue.All right, Dan, thank you very much.My friend, shake my hand.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Trump's attorney reacts to Russia investigation charges Video:::::Transcript for Trump's attorney reacts to Russia investigation charges Let's bring in the preside president's attorney, Jay sekulow.The president's team on several occasions denied any contacts with the Russians during the campaign.The president said he had nothing to do with Russia but from this plea agreement yesterday we know that Russians reached out to papadopoulos because he was a campaign adviser, they discussed these thousands of e-mails and dirt on Hillary Clinton that papadopoulos remained in regular contact with Russians and also with top campaign officials, so is the president prepared now to retract those denials of any contact?No, here's what you have, I mean you've got to look at the context when you mention, George, the document, the charging document.In it it says in paragraph 21 the trips this all led up to this purported trip that would take place between Russian officials and trump campaign officials and what does it say, this is the government's document.The trip proposed by defendant papadopoulos did not take place.Yeah, but that document also says -- hold on, hold on right there.That document also says that he was encouraged to take that trip by a top campaign official Sam Clovis who is now a white house adviser, so he was encouraged to take that trip even though it doesn't happen and it details months of contacts with the Russians before that and months of contacts with high campaign officials.Yeah, and, again, the charge of what was a violation of the law here was not proposed meetings with individuals, a professor that was Russian based.I think they met initially in London.The charge of what got George papadopoulos in trouble was that he lied to the FBI agent.About his contacts with the Russians.Yes, no question.That's what -- yes, that's what is in the charging document, George.That was part of the plea agreement but the position that the administration has advocated and the position that it continues to advocate and I think, by the way, as it continues to advocate as you look at the manafort plea, no mention of anything to do with the campaign there.In their charging document, the indictment with regard to papadopoulos, he was as Sarah Sanders said yesterday he was a volunteer with the campaign served on one of the committees.You've been involved in campaigns.There are a lot of these committees.He was evidently according to the documents that the government filed he was in contact with individuals that purported to be somehow involved with Russia or Russian government.Not clear from the documents what they were, the end result the meeting doesn't take place so what you this is all this conversation about collusion.Remember that, collusion in and of itself there's no crime of collusion.What is a violation of law here, I go back to that for George papadopoulos, the violation of the law, George -- Clearly but collusion is cooperation -- Not condoned by the administration.It's cooperation and that's what he was doing with Russians but back to that meeting he had with president trump and put that picture back up again March 31st of 2016.According to the document he said at that meeting he could set up a meeting with Mr. Putin.What was Mr. Trump's reaction to that?I don't know.I wasn't there and I have not talked to the president about that so I don't know.I do know this, the meeting that was being proposed did not take place.And that's clear in the government submission that they filed in the federal court.You spoke to Mr. Trump yesterday, correct?Yes.What was his reaction to these indictments and this plea agreement?Well, will et me say a couple things on that, first of all I won't give you obviously my conversations with the president of the United States.They're attorney/client privilege.I will tell you this, it was -- I gave him as we do as lawyers a kind of an analysis of what we had seen that morning with regard to the public document, all I'm giving you is what we saw which is the public documents, the indictment of Paul manafort and Richard Gates and discussed that with him.That was it.There's a story posted I think on one of the other networks that says there was this meeting with all of the lawyers in the residence for hours.I just want to say that that's not true.That did not take place.We had a conversation with the president discussed what the charges looked like and that was it.I obviously won't discuss any more -- anything else related to attorney/client privilege.That was the nature of the discussion in let me ask something else.The campaign chair and his deputy charged with laundering millions of dollar, $75 million in the documents so given that does he regret hiring Paul manafort?Well, remember this, Paul manafort was brought into the campaign for a period of time.He was the campaign chairman, his primary focus was the delegate issue.Don't forget, George, he was ultimately terminated by the president, by the then nominee.Because of the discussions that started coming up with regard to the Ukraine that started becoming information that was a distraction to the campaign and the administration then was -- then the campaign took action, removed him as the chairman so it wasn't as if this went on and when information became available nothing was done.It was.The president terminated -- Two -- Paul manafort's position.Two final questions.Can you say definitively that the president has ruled out firing Robert Mueller?Let me say this and I have said this there is no conversation regarding firing Robert Mueller.And there's no basis to fire Robert Mueller.Are you ruling it out?So -- I will say this, the president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he's had any intent of terminating Robert Mueller and the way it would work, you could only terminate a special counsel for cause and we just don't see any basis for cause.How about pardonsy is he ruling that out?I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons and pardons are not on the table.Jay sekulow, thank you very much for your time this morning.Thanks, George.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
What's next for Manafort, Gates amid federal charges Video:::::Transcript for What's next for Manafort, Gates amid federal charges All right, guys.That 12-count indictment against manafort and adviser Rick Gates makes no mention of collusion with Russia, but it could potentially be used as leverage in the special counsel's investigation.Our senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas has more from Washington and, Pierre, manafort and Gates are now out of custody but under house arrest and could face we're talking serious jail time if convicted.Reporter: Robin, good morning.That's right.They're under house arrest and if convicted could face up to 20 years in prison and you're right.That sweeping 12-count indictment makes no allegations about collusion with the Russians, but what the special counsel does do is argue that manafort engaged in a massive money laundering campaign to hide income made from doing business with Ukrainian officials who had alleged ties to Russia.The FBI says manafort laundered $18 million to finance a, quote, lavish lifestyle including spending $6.4 million on three homes in New York and Virginia and over a million dollars on clothes.His attorney denies any wrongdoing basically calling Mueller's case a sham.But make no mistake, former prosecutors tell us one of Mueller's goal is to see if manafort or Gates will cooperate, robin.With all that we've seen so far with the indictments and the plea agreement, it's cheer that a very broad net has been cast by Mueller.Reporter: That's right.It could include any member of the campaign with any connect connections to the Russians, Michael Flynn, for example, remains under intense investigation, bottom line, robin, in this case when the FBI comes knocking, you better be telling the truth because they probably know a lot more than they think you know.That's true.All right, Pierre, thanks.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
White House reacts to Russia investigation charges Video:::::Transcript for White House reacts to Russia investigation charges but first, of course, the white house facing new fallout from those bombshell indictments, special counsel Robert Mueller announcing charges against three of president trump's former advisers in connection with the Russia investigation.12 counts potentially decades in prison for the Paul manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, both men pled not guilty in court perhaps more significant the guilty plea from campaign foreign policy adviser George papadopoulos.In that he details months of contacts with Russians and others in the trump campaign.He has been secretly cooperating with the special counsel since his arrest in July.Our team in Washington covering every angle of the story and our chief white house correspondent Jon Karl starts us off.Good morning, Jon.Reporter: In a rare interview overnight John Kelly acknowledged the special counsel investigation at the very least has been a big distraction for the president and that he wants it over soon.Hours after news of the special Keo counsel indictments broke he aemerged from the white house.No comment on the indictment of the man who ran his campaign or the guilty plea by a former adviser.His chief of staff, however, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News most of the white house staff isn't concerned.I think the staff is very comfortable with simply serving the nation, the vast majority of the staff would have nothing to do with any of this kind of thing.Reporter: But Kelly also made it clear the white house wants Mueller to finish his investigation quickly.It would seem that they're towards the end of the witness pile and I don't know how much longer it could possibly go on but we're in great hopes it wraps up.It is very distracting to the president as it would be to any citizen to be investigated.Reporter: The indictment of former campaign chairman Paul manafort and his deputy Rick Gates makes no mention of the trump campaign.Potentially more serious, though, is the guilty plea from George papadopoulos.A former foreign policy adviser to the trump campaign who acknowledged contacting Russian operatives to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.And then lying about it.The white house said papadopoulos played an unpaid and very limited role during the campaign.But then candidate trump once personally praised papadopoulos in a "Washington post" interview.George papadopoulos, he's an oil and energy consultant, excellent guy.Reporter: And soon after he shared the photo of the two at the same table in a March 31st national security meeting.We've been saying from day one there's been no evidence of trump/russia collusion and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all.Reporter: But the George papadopoulos agreement is about the campaign.It is specifically about the campaign.It has nothing to do with the activities of the campaign.It has to do with his failure to tell the truth.Reporter: As for the president himself, he took to Twitter to say the special counsel should really be investigating Hillary Clinton.Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul manafort was part of the trump campaign.But why aren't crooked Hillary and the DEMs the focus?The white house press secretary was asked if the president would consider issuing pardons for Paul manafort and Rick Gates.She said it's too early to start talking about pardons.But, George, she certainly did not rule it out.Did not rule it out at all.Jon, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Former Trump adviser lied to FBI about dealings with Russians Video:::::Transcript for Former Trump adviser lied to FBI about dealings with Russians Jon, thanks very much.More on George papadopoulos.The trump campaign adviser who pled guilty about his contacts with Russians during the campaign.His agreement lays out months of contacts with Russia and top campaign officials.Our chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross here with the details.Good morning.Reporter: Good morning, George.The Russia investigation now has its first turncoat or whistle-blower among the president's men and women and the question this morning is who might he bring down?30-year-old George papadopoulos has emerged from obscurity with the best evidence yet of possible collusion between the trump campaign and the Russians.???it was one week after the inauguration of the 45th president that campaign adviser George papadopoulos met with FBI agents and proceeded to deny over and over that he had any dealings with the Russians.Donald Trump himself had consistently denied any connection too as in this exchange with ABC's Cecilia Vega.Did you or anyone in your campaign have any contact with Russia leading up to or during the campaign?Nothing at all?No, not at all he said but papadopoulos knew better and has admitted he lied to the FBI.That, in fact, shortly after becoming part of the trump and national security team seen in this campaign photo he met with two suspected Russian agents and that within a month the campaign adviser went to London and was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton with thousands of e-mails by his Russian connections.Connections that would be involved with crimes that were committed by the Russian government that are designed to help one campaign over the other.Reporter: The white house is now claiming papadopoulos was just an unpaid adviser with a minor role in the campaign.No activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign in that regard.Reporter: Yet according to the court documents papadopoulos reported to four senior campaign officials or advisers who offered encouragement with one telling him in an e-mail, great work.It was just six weeks after papadopoulos was in touch with his Russian connections that another group of Russians went to trump tower and also offered dirt on Hillary to Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul manafort.Trump junior says nothing came of it but that meeting too is under investigation by the special counsel, George.Brian, papadopoulos arrested back in July and they called him in the pleading agreement proactive cooperator.That suggests he could have been wearing a wire.That is a time tested technique the FBI use, people like this part of an alleged conspiracy to contact those in the conspiracy to see if they will implicate themselves.Brian Ross, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump blames Schumer for visa program NYC terror suspect used:::::President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for immigration policies he claims are connected to the terrorist attack in New York City that left eight people dead and many more injured.Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty," Trump said on Twitter Wednesday.Trump also reiterated his support for a "merit-based" immigration system.The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).@foxandfriends Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 The president's attack against Schumer follows a trend of directly blaming elected officials in cities and states hit by terrorist attacks.Trump made similar remarks about London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, following the attacks near London Bridge in June.On Tuesday, a man drove a rental truck onto a bike and jogging path in lower Manhattan near One World Trade Center in what New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called a "cowardly act of terror."Sebastian Sobczak/BeautifulGoal.Org via AP The driver in the attack was identified yesterday as Sayfullo Saipov, who is from Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan.Saipov entered the United States in 2010 through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.According to the State Department, the program issues about 55,000 visas per year to applicants, most of them from countries that don't send many migrs to the United States.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program was included in the broader immigration reform package passed in 1990 and was signed by then-president George H.W.Bush.The first visa lottery took place in 1995.Saipov has since become a legal permanent resident and has lived in Cincinnati, Tampa, and, most recently, Paterson, New Jersey, according to a law enforcement official.PacificCoastNews Schumer, a member of the House of Representatives at the time, is known to have played a key role in pushing for the program to be included in the comprehensive immigration bill.Susan Walsh/AP The New York senator tweeted Wednesday, "I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy."I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy.Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) November 1, 2017 I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America.President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution -- anti-terrorism funding -- which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget," Schumer said in a statement.Im calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also weighed in on Twitter, correcting Trump and pointing out that he and Schumer were both part of the group of lawmakers that "did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms."Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017 Overnight, conservative media outlet Breitbart News and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka joined a vocal chorus of critics from the right wing in targeting Schumer.Many on the right said the New York senator's role in passing the measure is a sign hes directly responsible for the attack in New York City.

Brokenshire to introduce Northern Ireland budget bill:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Brokenshire said the move was necessary to prevent Northern Ireland "running out of resources' The Northern Ireland secretary has said he will take steps to allow a budget bill to be introduced in Westminster.James Brokenshire said talks between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fin had failed to reach agreement to establish an executive.Sinn Fin said the latest talks had "ended in failure" but added the party was prepared to resume negotiations.The parties are attempting to end a 10-month deadlock that has left the region without a devolved administration.Sinn Fin's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said her party had tried to be "flexible", but "endless talks without conclusion are not sustainable".Mr Brokenshire said he would be ready to withdraw the budget bill if an an executive is formed before December.The budget would only deal with 2017-18 financial year, he said, adding that it did not mean a return to direct rule from Westminster.Northern Ireland's two largest parties have failed to reach an agreement in spite of numerous rounds of discussions since March, after the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed amid a bitter split between the parties in January.It is understood they have made little progress on key dividing issues.Sinn Fin's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish language viewed as the stumbling block in the negotiations.The DUP has said it wants to see the government press ahead with its budget plan, but Sinn Fin has warned that doing so would force an end to the talks.Mr Brokenshire said there were "consequences" of not having an executive in place to put forward the legislation this week."It is now very unlikely that an executive will be in place within a timetable to pass a budget by the end of November, which is the point at which we and the Northern Ireland Civil Service assess that Northern Ireland will begin to run out of resources", he said."No government could simply stand by and allow that to happen."Sinn Fin said the confidence and supply arrangement between the DUP and the Conservative party had "compounded" the problems the parties faced.The prime minister made the 1bn deal with the DUP after losing her majority in June's general election.'Latest possible juncture' Speaking at Stormont on Wednesday, the Northern Ireland secretary said he would be seeking independent advice on what steps should be taken to "reflect the current circumstances in MLA pay".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sinn Fin's Michelle O'Neill said she was disappointed the talks had failed Mr Brokenshire had previously said he would examine the issue of assembly members' salaries in the absence of devolution, amid calls for their salaries to be docked.The secretary of state stressed "important progress" had been made in discussions between the DUP and Sinn Fin.He also said the British and Irish governments would continue to work with the parties as they proceed with ongoing talks.Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said Mr Brokenshire had taken the budget decision with the "utmost reluctance and at the latest possible juncture".Both the UK and Irish government had "spared no effort" in supporting the talks between the DUP and Sinn Fin, he added."The issues under discussion - particularly those on language and culture - go to the heart of the divisions in society here in Northern Ireland," he said."However, I have always believed that it is possible to reach an honourable compromise."There have been sincere efforts to stretch for that and measurable progress in finding an agreed outcome had been made, but we are not there yet."'Intransigence' SDLP leader Colum Eastwood insisted the Secretary of State's move was direct rule.He pointed to the DUP-Tory deal as an issue at the talks."A Tory-DUP government will do nothing for the rights of people in the north," he said."It only strengthens the DUP's intransigence.""It will do nothing for the rights of Irish language speakers, the LGBT community or [Troubles]victims," he added.Northern Ireland business leaders have also expressed disappointment."Our members deserve better than a 'care and maintenance' administration with important decisions on business rates, infrastructure and many other areas, not currently being taken by Ministers, said the chief executives of Hospitality Ulster and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts and Colin Neill."Political instability is bad for business and our economy as a whole."
Theresa May: Take sex abuse claims to police:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The prime minister said all staff at Westminster should be "treated with respect".Theresa May said any allegations about serious sexual abuse in Parliament should go to the police as she promised a new "independent" process to handle complaints.The PM said she was "deeply concerned" by recent reports about alleged harassment and abuse at Westminster.She invited Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to a meeting to agree a new grievance procedure.Mr Corbyn said trade unions should be involved to support staff.The government has already promised a response "within days" following a range of recent allegations which have included claims of a lack of support for those making complaints.Opening Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mrs May said Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom had been meeting her counterparts in other parties to discuss a "common, transparent, independent" grievance procedure."We have a duty to ensure that everyone coming here to contribute to public life is treated with respect," she added.She said this included processes for the political parties to follow, investigations under the ministerial code and rules covering everyone working at the Palace of Westminster.Mr Corbyn said he was happy to meet the PM to discuss it, with a meeting scheduled for early next week.The SNP's Ian Blackford said his party would also work with the government "to ensure that we have a system we can be proud of".Whips' offices During PMQs, Labour's Lisa Nandy said that three years ago she had raised concerns with Mrs May that party whips' offices had used sexual abuse allegations to demand loyalty from MPs.At the time Mrs May, who was home secretary, said political parties would be included in the wide-ranging inquiry into child abuse she was announcing and that "every area where it is possible that people have been guilty of abuse" would be looked at.Responding to Ms Nandy in PMQs, she said she would look back at the questions raised, adding: "I will say to her that I am very clear, that the whips' office - I hope this goes for all whips' offices across this House - should make clear to people that where there are any sexual abuse allegations that could be of a criminal nature that people should go to the police."It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips' offices; those should go to the police - that continues to be the case."Ahead of PMQs, Mrs May's deputy, Damian Green, said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist were "completely false" and said he had instructed libel lawyers.Tory activist Kate Maltby had written in the Times that he "fleetingly" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a "suggestive" text message.Meanwhile Labour has launched an independent investigation into an activist's claim that she was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a party event in 2011.
Arron Banks faces EU referendum finance investigation:::::Image copyright PA The Electoral Commission says it is investigating whether ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks broke donation rules during the EU referendum.The probe will look at whether the Leave.EU chairman broke the rules over donations or loans made to campaigners.It will also look at Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Mr Banks is a registered director.Mr Banks said that a judge-led inquiry was needed "to clear this nonsense up once and for all".The commission said it launched investigations where there were "reasonable grounds" to believe offences had been committed.It is already carrying out separate probes into the spending returns submitted by the official Remain and Leave campaigns.Announcing the latest investigation, the commission said Better for the Country Ltd (BFTC) had made donations totalling 2.3m to campaigners in June 2016's referendum, while Mr Banks had given Leave.EU loans totalling 6m.The commission said its investigation would look at: Whether BFTC was the "true source of donations made to referendum campaigners in its name, or if it was acting as an agent".Whether recipients of the donations were given the required information about the donor What steps the recipients took to verify BFTC's "identity and permissibility" Whether or not Mr Banks was the "true source" of loans reported in his name Whether the recipients of the loans acted within the rules Whether any individual "facilitated a transaction with a non-qualifying person" Bob Posner of the Electoral Commission said: "Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread."Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters' confidence."It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place."In a statement issued by Leave.EU, Mr Banks said: "We believe that a judge-led inquiry reporting to Parliament that investigates the main campaign groups, Vote Leave, Britain Stronger In Europe and Leave.EU would be the best way to clear this nonsense up once and for all."He said it should also cover why the Electoral Commission allowed a leaflet to be sent by the government to each home in the UK just before the referendum spending cut-off date.Mr Banks added: "The 'Remain' Electoral Commission isn't up to the job and consists of political placemen from all main parties."This is the Remain establishment once again trying to discredit the result and it's all starting to get rather boring."
PMQs: Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash on tax avoidance:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn says "957 business jets in Isle of Man seems a bit excessive" Theresa May has defended her record in tackling tax avoidance as she clashed with Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons.The Labour leader said the fact the super-rich were paying less in tax now than in 2009 showed there was "one rule for them and one rule for the rest".He urged the PM to look into imports of private jets in the Isle of Man which he said could be used to dodge tax.Mrs May said an extra 160bn had been raised since 2010 and the top 1% were paying more in tax than ever before.During Prime Minister's Questions, she insisted the UK was "leading the world" in efforts to clamp down on tax-dodging and Revenue and Customs would continue to close down loopholes where they found them.Mr Corbyn referred to documents about global tax practices, reportedly leaked from a law firm in Bermuda, which he said were being compared in some quarters with the disclosures in the 2016 Panama Papers.He urged Mrs May to launch an investigation into VAT avoidance allegations linked to what he said was the unusual proliferation of business jets in the Isle of Man.'A bit excessive' The Labour leader said 957 corporate jets imported to the Isle of Man "seems a bit excessive for any island anywhere", adding he hoped due tax is collected by those trying to avoid it.He told MPs the then Labour government intervened in 2010 via HMRC to shut down an Isle of Man scheme used to import yachts into the European Union as a way of avoiding tax."A similar scheme has recently been exposed relating to the import of business jets into the Isle of Man," he said."So can the prime minister assure the House that HMRC investigates these new allegations diligently?"Mrs May assured Mr Corbyn that Revenue and Customs takes "seriously" allegations of tax avoidance which are referred to it and that it was the agency's "job" to collect more tax.She said: "We've secured almost 160 billion in additional compliance revenues since 2010 through a number of measures that we have taken to ensure we clamp down on tax evasion and avoidance."The Isle of Man government launched a review last week into the practice of importing business jets, saying it "is imperative that we take steps to defend the Isle of Man's position".Chief minister Howard Quayle said it had no evidence at this stage of any wrongdoing in terms of VAT payments and made clear that the Isle of Man followed the same rules and policy as the UK government.More broadly, the Labour leader said Tory MPs voted against tighter rules on beneficial ownership in the Commons on Tuesday but Mrs May said it was her predecessor David Cameron who had first put the issue on the G20's agenda in 2013 and accused Labour of blocking tax avoidance measures ahead of the general election.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg told Daily Politics Mr Corbyn had used the issue to "have a go" at the government on an issue he regarded as his "home turf".But she said the tit-for-tat exchanges had generated more heat than light and it remained to be seen whether Mr Corbyn had more specific information connecting the leaked reports to the UK.
Liam Fox wants EU deal but 'not afraid' of not getting one:::::Image copyright House of Commons The UK should avoid giving the impression it does not want a Brexit deal or that it would take one at any price, Liam Fox has told MPs.The international trade secretary said he was "keen" on getting agreement but "not afraid" of ending up without one.He told a Commons committee some within the EU wanted a "political rather than an economic" settlement based on deterring other members from leaving.Talk of punishing Britain, he said, was the "language of a gang, not a club".Ministers say they believe a comprehensive deal with the EU, covering the terms of withdrawal and the UK's future relations, is possible by the March 2019 deadline for the UK leaving, but contingency plans should be put in place in case this does not happen.Opinion is split within the Conservatives, however, with some senior figures, including Home Secretary Amber Rudd and former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggesting that a no-deal scenario was "unthinkable".Other MPs disagree, arguing that the UK would still be better off outside the EU even if no trade accord was agreed.Asked about internal party Brexit divisions as he gave evidence to the Commons International Trade Committee, Mr Fox suggested that his party should be thinking within different "parameters"."We need to stay away from language which suggests we do not want a deal or we want a deal at any price.I think either of these are unhelpful negotiating positions," he said."I am very keen we get a deal with the EU but I am not afraid of not getting a deal.Those who say we want a deal at any price undermine our negotiating hand but those who say we want no deal and want to walk away are not taking a realistic view of our economic position."'Frustrated' Like others, Mr Fox said he was "frustrated" by how long it was taking for the EU to agree to begin discussions on post-Brexit relations in areas such as trade and defence.This, he suggested, showed that some within the European Commission were putting political considerations ahead of the economic interests of their constituents.Asked by Tory MP Nigel Evans if some EU officials wanted to "pay us back" for voting to leave, Mr Fox said: "The language, which is regrettable, that some people want to punish Britain for leaving in case anyone else would want to leave is the language of a gang not a club."When it leaves the EU in March 2019, Mr Fox said the UK would also exit the single market and customs union and would become an independent "legal entity".On his trade priorities, he signalled he wanted to build on the UK's current "good performance" in export markets - by maintaining access to existing EU trade agreements with South Korea and Switzerland.In the longer-term, he said post-Brexit trade agreements with the US, Australia and New Zealand were a priority, as was increasing British business investment abroad to reduce the UK's current account deficit.
New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption William Hague tells Radio 4's Today a second EU referendum wouldn't be good for the country Holding another referendum on Brexit would be the most "divisive" moment in British politics for more than 100 years, Lord Hague has said.The former foreign secretary warned of the risk of a "hate-filled" campaign if the government attempted to revisit the issue and tell people "they were wrong" when voting to leave in 2016.He said he would be "more likely" to vote leave if there was another poll."You can't go around in circles.We have to stick to the decision."Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the UK's negotiations with the EU had taken a "fairly predictable" course up to now and it was incumbent on both sides to try and secure a breakthrough.Lord Hague, a Remain supporter who left frontline politics in 2015, said that while quitting the EU without a deal could not be ruled out, he believed it would not be a good outcome.Neither the Conservatives nor Labour support another referendum on the terms of the UK's exit but MPs are demanding a vote in Parliament on the deal negotiated by Theresa May's government - although this is unlikely to prevent the UK from leaving in March 2019.The Lib Dems have said the public are entitled to change their mind and should be given a final say on the withdrawal agreement in what they have claimed would be the "first referendum on the facts".But the former Conservative leader suggested that would be calamitous for the country, given that more people had voted to leave the EU in June 2016 - when 17.4 million people, or 51.9% of those turning out, backed Leave - than had voted for any government in British history."It would be the most divisive event in this country since the arguments over Irish home rule at least, to try and go back over this issue," he said."Imagine going back to the people of this country and saying 'you got this wrong in the referendum, you may have turned out in record numbers and most of the country voted to leave but nevertheless we think you got it wrong and we are going to run it again'."Imagine the hate-filled campaign that would divide this country.I do not think that is a price worth paying."The issue of whether to grant Ireland self-government within the UK dominated British politics for decades during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.
PM's deputy Damian Green denies inappropriate behaviour claim:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green, has said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist are "completely false".Mr Green has instructed libel lawyers over the claims, the BBC understands.Tory activist Kate Maltby wrote in the Times that he "fleetingly" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a "suggestive" text message.The cabinet secretary is to investigate whether Mr Green broke the ministerial code.Ms Maltby, 31, a writer and academic, said Mr Green, 61, said he had sent her the text message after she posed in a corset for the Times.According to her article in the paper, it read: "Long time no see.But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I felt impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?"The encounters left her feeling "awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised", she wrote.Mr Green, now first secretary of state, and Theresa May's effective deputy, said he had known Ms Maltby since 2014 and the pair "had a drink as friends twice-yearly"."The text I sent after she appeared in a newspaper article was sent in that spirit - as two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch up - and nothing more," he said."This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend."He also denied the claim he put his hand on Ms Maltby's knee.Asked about the claims in the Times as he left his home on Wednesday morning, Mr Green told reporters: "All these allegations are completely false."The ministerial code requires ministers to "behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety".Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Small Business Minister Margot James said there was no need for Mr Green to resign during the cabinet secretary's investigation."I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption William Hague tells Today he hopes Westminster is entering an era of greater accountability It comes as allegations and rumours relating to sexual harassment and abuse by MPs swirl around Westminster.'Urgent action promised' On Tuesday, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011.She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled.In a separate case, an anonymous woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an MP on a foreign work trip last year told the Guardian her allegations were not taken seriously.Earlier this week, a spokesman for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon confirmed he was once rebuked by a journalist for putting his hand on her knee during dinner.Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers.Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs.The government has promised urgent action to improve the handling of complaints about the way MPs' staff are treated.
Labour demands Brexit studies release:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Labour is seeking to up the pressure on ministers over their refusal to release a series of Brexit impact studies.The government has confirmed that 58 reports looking at different sectors of the economy have been prepared.But it is resisting calls to publish them, saying to do so would undermine the UK's negotiating position.On Wednesday Labour will use what it calls an "ancient, but still effective" Parliamentary tool to force the government's hand.A "humble address", tabled by shadow Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, would request the Queen to direct Brexit Secretary David Davis to release the documents.The vote will take place during Labour's opposition day debate in the Commons.Sir Keir said: "This debate is about transparency and accountability."Ministers cannot keep withholding vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy."The Labour Brexit spokesman recalled Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge in January to provide businesses with "as much certainty as possible" during the Brexit process.On Monday the government published the list of 58 sectors that have been looked at, ranging from aerospace and aviation to tourism and legal services.Some Conservative MPs, as well as opposition parties, have been calling for them to be released.But Mr Davis set out the government's stance in evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee on Tuesday."There was a House of Commons vote in December of last year where we said that we are not required to release anything which undermines the negotiation or the national interest frankly, or the negotiating stance of the British government," he told peers."That is the reasoning behind it."Brexit negotiations are set to resume on 9 and 10 November with the UK seeking to make enough progress to persuade the EU to move talks onto future issues like trade.
Green Party's Lucas calls for consent lessons for MPs:::::Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas has called for compulsory training for MPs to teach them about consent.It comes as allegations and rumours relating to sexual harassment and abuse by MPs swirl around Westminster.The Green MP told BBC 5 Live: "What we need is compulsory training for all MPs.How to understand what consent is."Some basic stuff that you might have thought people would have gained along the way before they got into parliament, but clearly they haven't."The Greens campaign for consent lessons to be part of compulsory Personal, Social and Health Education in schools.The party's deputy leader Amelia Womack said "many in Westminster are utterly failing to understand the power dynamics at play between male MPs, senior political party figures and other staff like assistants and researchers".She said lessons in professional boundaries and "what is and isn't appropriate in the workplace" were needed.
Royal Navy ships 'cannibalised for parts', report finds:::::Image copyright BAE Systems Image caption The building of third Astute submarine, HMS Artful, was delayed because parts were taken during its construction A shortage of spares for Royal Navy warships and submarines has forced the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to strip parts from the rest of the fleet, the National Audit Office (NAO) has found.An NAO investigation found equipment "cannibalisation" had increased by 49% over the past five years.The spending watchdog warned that the practice was costing the MoD millions of pounds and delayed construction.The MoD said components were only swapped when "absolutely necessary".Currently, the Navy has 19 frigates and destroyers and seven attack submarines - but at times they lack the spare parts they need to go to sea.The NAO said building the third Astute class submarine, HMS Artful, was delayed by 42 days because parts were taken during its construction - adding nearly 5m to the overall cost.The vessel, built in Barrow in Cumbria, completed its maiden dive in 2014.High-intensity operations The NAO found that, last year, there were 795 instances when spare parts had to be removed from one vessel and given to another - the equivalent of 66 a month, up from 30 a month in 2005.Between April 2012 and March 2017, there were 3,230 instances involving 6,378 parts, their investigation found.The NAO report noted that in some circumstances, such as during high-intensity operations, cannibalisation could be the most effective way to keep vessels at sea.But it said it also increased costs.The NAO said the MoD itself had identified that cannibalisation had affected submarines currently in production "leading to an estimated 40m cost increase".The watchdog said cuts to the maritime support budget, along with the MoD's failure to monitor the practice, had exacerbated the problem."In the past two years, the Navy has removed an estimated 92m from its maritime support in-year budgets," the report said.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Less than 0.5% of parts we use come from swapping components, and we only do this when it's absolutely necessary to get ships out of port and back on to operations more quickly."We continue to make improvements to how we manage this long-established practice."
'Despicable' fraud costs NHS in England £1bn a year:::::Image copyright Getty Images More will be done to protect the NHS in England from "despicable" acts of fraud, the head of the health service's new anti-fraud body has said.Sue Frith promised a crackdown as she released figures suggesting the yearly bill for fraud in the NHS topped 1bn.Cases include patients falsely claiming for exemptions on dental and prescription fees, and dentists charging for work they had not done.Ms Frith said the fraud takes vital funds from front line care.Ms Frith, the chief executive of the NHS Counter Fraud Agency, said it would be looking at new ways to fight the crime.The analysis by her team estimated that 1.25bn of fraud is being committed each year by patients, staff and contractors - the first time the health service has put a figure on total fraud committed itself.The sum represents about 1% of the NHS budget.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.The most common frauds The two biggest single areas of fraud were related to patients and procurement of good and services, both of which was likely to cost the NHS in excess of 200m a year each, according to Ms Frith.She said patient fraud included cases where people wrongly claimed for exemptions for the cost of things like prescriptions and dental fees.Meanwhile, payroll fraud was thought to be costing 90m a year, while dentists were said to be claiming around 70m in work on NHS patients that has not been done.Image copyright DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Ms Frith said: "People may think it is just a small amount, but in large volumes it adds up and has an impact.It is criminal behaviour."It is despicable people would even claim things they are not entitled to.This is money that should be spent on front line patient care."She acknowledged the NHS must do better at detecting and preventing fraud.Last year investigators successfully pursued cases worth 9.6m, although another 30m of cases are pending.But this is only a small fraction of what she suspects is out there.Ms Frith said the 1.25bn was probably on the conservative side - previous estimates by experts have put it even higher.She believes the new organisation, which is officially formed on Wednesday, will be able to improve on this detection rate.It has been given independent status and allowed to focus solely on fraud.Its predecessor organisation, NHS Protect, also covered security.Responsibility for security has now been devolved down to local NHS trusts and the budget for tackling fraud increased by over 10%.This will also mean more field officers to be appointed to gather evidence, as well as a greater effort on fraud prevention by reviewing contracts and systems put in place to safeguard against fraud, she said.
Labour activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Bex Bailey's interview with Radio 4's PM A Labour activist has said she was raped at a party event and that a senior Labour official discouraged her from reporting the attack.Bex Bailey said she was told reporting the 2011 incident could "damage" her and that she was given no advice on what she should do next.She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled.Labour said it had launched an independent investigation.This will look at "claims that a party employee acted improperly over these 2011 allegations", the party said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Bailey had shown "incredible bravery" in speaking out and said she had his "full support and solidarity".The issue of sexual abuse within politics and the parties' response has come under the microscope after recent allegations about sexual harassment in Parliament.Labour has said "robust procedures" both "inside as well as outside Parliament" are needed and Jeremy Corbyn has written to members urging anyone with a complaint to come forward using "confidential party procedures".Ms Bailey, who is calling for an independent body free from political "bias", said there was now a recognition that "it's a problem in every party at every level".'Ashamed' The 25-year-old is a former member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee.In an interview with PM on BBC Radio 4, she said she had been 19 when she was raped by someone senior to her within the Labour Party who was not an MP.She said she had "tried to pretend it hadn't happened" and did not report the attack to the police at the time."I was scared, I felt ashamed, I know that the Labour Party, like any family, loves a good gossip - and I didn't want people to know and I also was worried that I wouldn't be believed if I did," she said.Two years later, she did confide in a party official."It took me a while to summon up the courage to tell anyone in the party," she said."But when I did, I told a senior member of staff, who told me... or it was suggested to me that I not report it, I was told that if I did it might damage me - and that might be their genuine view, it might be that that was the case in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue anyway."Ms Bailey said she was not given good advice and was "not signposted to anyone else that could", and there seemed to be no procedure to report the incident.'Actual change' "I don't think I was even given a cup of tea at the time," she said."It was quite a horrible experience and this is why I've been fighting so hard for changes to the way that we do this."She is calling for an independent agency, like a charity, so allegations are dealt with free from "political bias" and complainants do not feel they will be "penalised".This body should provide advice on taking the matter to the police or, anonymously, to the party, she said.Labour's process relies on people reporting an attack to someone within the party - who is "inclined to be loyal to the Labour Party", she said."It's important that we need to make sure that this results in actual change in our parties as well as in Parliament, rather than letting it all blow over," she said.Ms Bailey said she had seen "a lot of brave women" speak out in recent days and weeks, and had chosen to do so to secure the changes she has campaigned for."I just really hope that all the horrible things that we're seeing will at least result in some sort of change in our parties as well as in Parliament."'Great bravery' A Labour Party spokesman said: "The Labour Party takes these allegations extremely seriously.It takes great courage for victims of rape to come forward - and all support must and will be made available to them."We would strongly recommend that the police investigate the allegations of criminal actions that Bex Bailey has made."Labour will also launch an independent investigation into claims that a party employee acted improperly over these 2011 allegations."Mr Corbyn added: "There will be no tolerance in the Labour Party for sexism, harassment or abuse."Whatever it takes, we are absolutely committed to rooting it out."Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader in 2011, said he was "shocked" by Ms Bailey's "horrific allegations".He added: "She is showing great bravery and courage in speaking out.Victims must be supported when they come forward.These allegations must be properly investigated by the police and the Labour Party."Tory 'dossier' Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers.Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the list as "both a mixture of unsavoury allegations, reports of well-known relationships, and some claims that are furiously denied".
UK territories eligible for development aid:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A British Virgin Islands residents describe the aftermath of two hurricanes Britain will now be able to spend official development aid on hurricane hit-islands after changes to international rules agreed in Paris.During this year's hurricane season the UK government was not able to release funds to its Caribbean territories as they were deemed too rich.But the body that sets rules on aid said money could be spent when catastrophic humanitarian crises hit.The international development secretary described it as a "real step forward".The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ruled on Tuesday that aid could be used for short-term help for middle-income countries.Under current OECD rules, some of the small island nations in the Caribbean that were hit by Hurricane Irma last month were unable to receive official development assistance - known as ODA - because their national incomes are too high.The OECD's development assistance committee (DAC) rejected a UK plan for small island states to be allowed to waive the rules in emergency.But instead the 30 member countries backed a different plan to use official aid in temporary emergencies but on the crucial condition that no ODA is diverted from existing recipients in the process.Image copyright MOD Image caption International rules meant the UK could not spend its aid budget to help the British Virgin Islands The DAC also agreed to establish a new mechanism for middle-income countries to be reinstated on to the list of ODA-eligible recipients if they suffer a long-term economic decline.Last month the British overseas territories of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma.But there was controversy after it was revealed that Britain's 13bn aid budget could not be used to help repair the islands.All three had gross national incomes higher than the benchmark set for countries to be eligible for ODA.International Development Secretary Priti Patel said: "[The] agreement is a real step forward, and we welcome the clear support from the head of the OECD for our efforts."
NI budget planned amid deadlocked Stormont talks:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The DUP and Sinn Fin have been involved in talks to end a 10-month deadlock at Stormont Plans have been put in place to begin legislating for a Northern Ireland budget at Westminster, as a further round of talks to restore power-sharing at Stormont broke up without agreement.Party whips at Westminster have been asked to allow time for a budget bill.Talks between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fin to end their deadlock will resume on Wednesday.The government will update the House of Commons on the negotiations, which have broken through another deadline.Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire will assess the chances of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fin agreeing a deal.Image copyright PA Image caption Sinn Fin is understood to have asked the government to release funding for Troubles inquests The parties have been involved in negotiations in an attempt to end a 10-month deadlock that has left Northern Ireland without a devolved administration.They have failed to reach an agreement in spite of numerous rounds of discussions, with Sinn Fin's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish language viewed as the main dividing issue.The government had warned that it it would have no choice but to intervene, starting with legislation for a budget for Northern Ireland, if a deal is not made this week.The BBC has learnt that plans have been made to begin work on a budget bill in the House of Commons in the week beginning 13 November.Image copyright PA Image caption James Brokenshire will assess the state of the talks on Tuesday night A budget for the 2017-18 financial year had not been put in place by the Northern Ireland Executive before its collapse in January in a bitter dispute between the DUP and Sinn Fin.In the absence of executive ministers, civil servants have been using emergency powers to keep money flowing to public services.But they have only been able to use 95% of Northern Ireland's block grant from Westminster.On Monday night, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire extended the deadline for the talks between the DUP and Sinn Fin, reporting that "progress had been made" during the day.He said the parties had made "certain additional requests" of the government, which it would have to consider.The BBC understands that Sinn Fin have asked the government to release 150m to fund inquests for Troubles-related deaths.The money had been pledged as part of the Fresh Start political agreement at Stormont in 2015 but had not been made available.It is understood that the parties have yet to agree on other key issues.During a break from the talks on Tuesday, Sinn Fin's Conor Murphy refused to confirm or deny that funding for Troubles legacy issues was under discussion.He said his party do not want to give details about the inter-party talks as "this is a very key time".Mr Murphy added that "credibility" is an issue the longer the talks go on.
House of Lords 'should cut number of peers to 600':::::Image copyright House of Lords Image caption The Lords Speaker said cross-party agreement was vital to see the changes through Peers would be limited to 15 years in the House of Lords as part of plans to cut membership by a quarter from the current 800 over the next decade.With 799 eligible members, the Lords is the world's second largest legislative body after China's People's Congress.Ex-civil servant and cross-bench peer Lord Burns was commissioned by Lords Speaker Lord Fowler to look at ways to slim down the size of the Lords.His report proposes capping the size of the House of Lords to 600 members.The House of Lords, most of whose members are appointed, plays an important role in scrutinising and revising government legislation but its critics say it has become bloated.The Burns report recommends a "two-out, one-in" system for reducing the size of the chamber, with only half of those peers relinquishing their seats over the next decade or so being replaced.It envisages 150 peers departing between 2017 and 2022, taking into account deaths and voluntary retirements, with this number increasing to 250 between 2022 and 2027.During that period, only 200 new peerages would be approved, reducing the total size of the House to 600. Who sits in the Lords?Image copyright House of Lords Image caption The House of Lords plays an important role in scrutinising and revising government legislation The Conservatives have the largest number of peers - with 252 members - but they do not have a majority as they are heavily outnumbered by other groups.Labour has 191 peers while the Lib Dems have 100.There are 181 crossbenchers who are nominally independent and do not take the whip of any of the main parties.There are 29 non-affiliated peers - individuals who once belonged to a party but have since left - and 14 peers who represent other parties such as UKIP, the Green Party and the Democratic Unionists.There are 26 spots set aside for Anglican bishops although only 24 of these are currently filled.There are 91 hereditary peers who remain following the expulsion of their remaining number in 1999.Each time one of their number dies, they are replaced by a hereditary peer of the same political persuasion in a by-election.There are a handful of peers who are currently ineligible because they are on leave of absence or are disqualified because there are members of the Supreme Court or European Parliament.The report suggests political parties would be expected to "contribute the same proportion" of their current membership each year towards meeting its target and if necessary "persuade" individuals to stand down.Under its formula, 129 Conservative peers would be expected to depart by 2027 while Labour and the Lib Dems would see 102 and 50 departures respectively and 93 crossbenchers would also leave.At the moment, peers can serve for life once appointed, although rules brought introduced in 2014 making it easier for them to retire has increased the turnover in the House.In the past five years, 125 peers have either retired or died.'Radical' Lord Fowler said none of the proposed changes required legislation and could be achieved within a decade with the support of the parties and the government.The report envisages the 91 existing hereditary peers and 26 bishops remaining in place but it notes that ministers would have to decide whether it was "sustainable" for hereditaries to make up a larger proportion of the total number than they do now.The key recommendations include: All new peers would be expected to give an undertaking to stand down after 15 years or breach the code of conduct.No party would be allowed an absolute political majority A minimum of 20% of seats would be reserved for independent crossbenchers, members largely appointed by the House of Lords Appointment Commission Political appointments would be shared between the parties in line with the result of the previous general election This would be defined as an average of the parties' share of the national vote and of the seats won in the House of Commons A new category of life peerage could potentially be created which does not grant membership of the Lords The changes are designed to ensure the future make-up of the House of Lords reflects "the political views of the country over the medium term".Alternative options rejected by the committee include setting a mandatory retirement age and removing members with the lowest attendance and participation rates.Lord Fowler said the Lords played a vital role in holding the government to account.Image caption The UK's most senior Anglican clergy will continue to sit in the Lords But he added: "However with over 800 members - about 150 more than the Commons - we are too large.The time has now come to take action to correct this and put a cap on numbers for the future."A smaller, more effective house will be able to build public confidence and support for its crucial constitutional role in checking bills before they become law."Lord Burns said his proposals were a "radical but achievable" answer to an issue that had "defied resolution for so long"."Our proposals would see the numbers come down to 600 and stay there, while also allowing the membership to be refreshed and to reflect changing public opinion over time," he said.Downing Street said it would study the report carefully but "comprehensive" reforms were not a priority.
Fixed-odds maximum bet 'could drop to £2':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I was completely caught up in gambling' The maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals could drop to as little as 2 under a government review.Currently, people can bet up to 100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, but ministers are considering a new limit somewhere between 2 and 50.The consultation aims to reduce the risk of people suffering large losses and to tighten up advertising rules.The Association of British Bookmakers said the onus was on the gambling industry to help cut problem gambling.According to a government consultation, cutting the stake to 2 would cost the industry over the next 10 years.But problem gamblers say it is time for action to be taken - including, but not only, lessening the amount they can lose in one hit.Gambling vlogger Andrew Margett told BBC Radio 5live how the machines, also known as FOBTs, proved addictive: "I was just in a trance, in a complete bubble, playing it.Hitting the button, hitting the button, hitting the button."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nick Eardley explains how the machines work As part of the government review: The Gambling Commission - the industry's regulator - will consult on changes to protect online players.Broadcasters, advertisers, industry and support groups will draw up an advertising campaign to promote responsible gambling, with an annual budget of up to 7m.New advertising guidelines will be drafted to protect problem gamblers, children and young people.Access by under-18s to gambling content and channels on social media will be restricted.Gambling companies are being told to step up funding for research, education and treatment.If they don't, operators may face a levy.Culture minister Tracey Crouch said current laws on gaming machines - which critics have called the "crack cocaine of gambling" - were "inappropriate"."It is vital that we strike the right balance between socially responsible growth and protecting the most vulnerable, including children, from gambling-related harm," she said."We have seen online gambling grow rapidly and we need to protect players in this space, while also making sure those experiencing harm relating to gambling receive the help they need," she said.But in an urgent question session in the Commons, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the government was kicking the issue into "the long grass" and added that action, rather than a consultation, was needed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Bookies have won' over fixed-odds machines "There's an old maxim that the bookies always win, and they've won again today," he said.Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader, claimed that 450,000 children are gambling on a weekly basis.Labour wants a new gambling bill to look at the explosion of digital and online products - to stop children gambling on phones and to protect vulnerable people.Carolyn Harris MP, who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on the issues involved, said there was overwhelming evidence people's lives were being destroyed by the machines."When you see the statistics that 31% per cent of people who use these machines are earning less than 10,000... Where do they get the money?Because they are not earning it," she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme.The government began to look again at gambling in October 2016, when it made a "call for evidence" on the number and location of gaming machines and the measures in place to protect players.Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops from 1999, and offer computerised games including roulette and blackjack at the touch of a button.The government is consulting on 11 different types of gaming machine, with stakes ranging from 30p to 5.Each machine accepts bets up to a pre-set maximum and pays out according to fixed odds on the simulated outcomes of games.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the brain of a gambling addict 'Reducing FOBT odds is a matter of principle', by Amol Rajan, media editor Like every other industry, gambling has been radically transformed by technology.The advent of smartphones has made gambling much easier, more convenient, and constantly present than it was before.For centuries, gambling was for the most part an activity or habit that you had to move towards.Now, thanks to the internet, the gambling comes to you.It is dangerous to reduce the debate of FOBTs to one about economics: how much is raised in tax revenue; potential job losses; the impact on our high streets and so on.It is rather also a question of principle.In a free or liberal society, is it reasonable to let fully informed adults of sound mind make their own decisions about how to spend - and yes, waste - their money?Perhaps it is; but it becomes intolerable when this freedom harms others.It seems that public opinion has moved to the view that negative social consequences and harm have flowed from the gambling industry's tendency to cluster in areas of deprivation and high unemployment.Malcolm George, of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the government shared its wish to identify problem gamblers and get them help.But restricting terminals in betting shops would redirect problem gamblers to other avenues where there were fewer controls on the amount of gambling, he said."Just as alcohol policy in this country is not solely determined by alcoholics" he added, there needs to be an environment for the "vast majority who gamble responsibly".The British Amusement Catering Trade Association's John White said the government needed to "strike the right balance", but stakes should be "quite substantially" reduced, he said.Asked about job loss fears, he said half of high street adult gaming centres had disappearing since FOBTs were introduced.Tax law changes in 2001 led to a vast increase in the number of terminals.By 2005, about 20,000 terminals were in use and more than 34,000 are now found across the UK, according to the Gambling Commission.
Brexit: UK-EU negotiations to resume next week:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The cabinet discussed Brexit at Tuesday's meeting Brexit discussions are to resume next week as the UK's preparations for its departure in 2019 are being ramped up.A joint statement from Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's Michel Barnier said they would hold negotiations on November 9 and 10.Mr Davis told peers that the failure to secure a deal with the EU was "not impossible but very, very improbable".No 10 said 3,000 new Brexit jobs have been created in the civil service while the Treasury has set aside 500m.At a meeting of the cabinet earlier, Theresa May and her senior ministers discussed a range of "negotiated outcomes" leading up to the UK's departure in March 2019.The BBC's Iain Watson said although Downing Street was insisting that the government "would be ready for all scenarios", the tone at cabinet was that the UK was "working towards a deal".And Mr Davis told a Lords EU sub-committee that a no deal outcome - which has been talked up in recent months by some Tories - was not the best result as far as he was concerned.Following the meeting, Downing Street said Whitehall was accelerating its preparations for the UK's departure by hiring 3,000 new staff in Brexit-related roles, including 300 lawyers.Revenue and Customs could also recruit between 3,000 and 5,000 extra staff by 2019 while up to 300 different programmes of work relating to Brexit are being pursued across Whitehall.The Treasury has already earmarked 250m of Brexit-related spending for 2018, No 10 added.Chancellor Philip Hammond was criticised by some MPs for suggesting last month that financial preparations for the possibility of a no-deal outcome would only begin at the last minute.Downing Street was criticised on Monday for not publishing details of assessments into the impact of Brexit on different sectors of the economy after revealing that 58 different studies had been conducted.Former chancellor Ken Clarke said their publication would make for an "informed debate", saying that the "suspicion" would be that they contained things that the government "does not want the public to see".Speaking to the BBC, Mr Clarke - the only Tory MP to oppose triggering Article 50 - also defended his decision to hold a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday.He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that he, former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour peer Lord Adonis were "of course not negotiating" with Mr Barnier but wanted to bring themselves "up to date" with the full implications of the UK's departure from the EU.While he claimed that many EU politicians were "baffled" by the UK's negotiating objectives, he said he believed that Mr Barnier did want to recommend that a second phase of talks on the UK's future relationship with the EU should begin in December.
China ban on foreign waste imports 'is opportunity':::::China's plans to ban imports of foreign waste present an "opportunity" for the UK, an environment minister has said.Therese Coffey said she understood the plans were "a headache" but challenged the UK to improve the quality of its waste and reprocess more at home.She was speaking to MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee.China announced plans to ban imports of 24 grades of rubbish in July, reducing the tonnes of the world's waste it imports to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.The ban is expected to come into effect by January next year.Ms Coffey told the committee: "I can understand why it's a headache but actually the overall direction China is taking is to say we want to have higher quality of waste we are going to process."So it's a good challenge to us, to our industry, to us as a country, to improve the quality of the waste we have."It gives us an opportunity to reprocess more here, rather than exporting to the other side of the world just because it's a bit cheaper to do so."However Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, questioned the government's sense of urgency.She said: "This is happening in eight weeks.It just sounds incredibly lackadaisical.It doesn't sound like the issue is being treated with the urgency that it presumably deserves."Asked if the UK would have the infrastructure to cope with the change Ms Coffey said: "The industry are saying we need more capacity."I've already encouraged them to provide the capacity that they believe we need."But chair of the Environmental Audit Committee Mary Creagh said: "You've encouraged the industry to create more processing facilities here but these are big capital intensive plans that stick around for 20 or 40 years."Your warm words of encouragement are not going to be enough to encourage businesses, many of them multi-nationals, to invest in reprocessing here."The committee also asked whether Ms Coffey had seen a report by the Department for Exiting the European Union on the impact of Brexit on the waste sector, among more than 50 impact reports undertaken by the department.Ms Coffey responded she would need to confirm whether the report was based on analysis by Department for Exiting the European Union or her own department."We have discussed various elements... an amount of analysis has been done.I cannot tell you right here and now what analysis is in that report and I've asked for clarity myself."
Former Aberdeen MP Frank Doran dies aged 68:::::Image caption Mr Doran served two separate stints in the House of Commons Former Aberdeen MP Frank Doran has died aged 68, his family have confirmed.First elected in 1987, Mr Doran served two separate stints as a Labour MP for the city before standing down in 2015.He first represented Aberdeen South, before losing that seat to the Conservatives in 1992.He returned to parliament in 1997 for Aberdeen Central, and later Aberdeen North.Mr Doran, who has two sons, married fellow Labour MP Dame Joan Ruddock in 2010.Posting a tribute on Twitter, she said he was "an exceptional person and a wonderful husband, who touched so many lives".Mr Doran chaired Westminster's administration committee for five years, as well as serving as an aide to then Trade Minister Ian McCartney in Tony Blair's government.Fellow North East Labour parliamentarian Lewis Macdonald said Mr Doran had "served with distinction".He said: "Our thoughts are with Frank's loved ones at this time.The Labour family in the North East has lost a strong voice for working people."His work to support the families of the Piper Alpha tragedy was so important for so many, as was his tireless campaigning for safety in the oil and gas industry during his time as an MP."First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also posted condolences on Twitter, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Mr Doran was a "great friend, great trade unionist and a great colleague".
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
A pint of view: What do farmers think about Brexit?:::::What do the farmers out in the field, in the dairy and in the milking parlour think about Brexit?No-one knows what's around the corner for the dairy industry.Specific negotiations over a future trade deal haven't even started.Some experts predict oblivion; others see opportunity.So let's start with what we do know: the state of the industry 20 years ago, and what it's like today.Image caption Currently the EU is UK dairy's biggest trading partner, with 80 per cent of exports going there.The number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically: In 1996 there were around 35,000.Now there are around 13,000 - a drop of almost two-thirds.Farms are getting bigger: The average herd size was 75 cows and now it's 140.And as for the cost of a pint: back in 1996 it was 36 pence, now it's 43 pence - and many farmers say it's too low.So how do those working in the industry feel about what the next 20 years may hold?Image caption James and Rhiannan feel that Brexit has given them - and their son Ethan - the chance of a more secure future.James and Rhiannan Lomas have a dairy farm of around 200 cows in Cheshire.They almost went out of business two years ago because of the collapse in the milk price.But now they are part of a small number of farms starting to export liquid milk (as opposed to powdered or products such as cheese) to Qatar.The Middle East nation was left without milk almost overnight after a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies.Mr Lomas says: "It's amazing.Every day we thought of giving it all up.But hopefully now Brexit will improve our outlook and open up a lot of markets - if the politicians get it right."He adds that there have definitely been some dark times."Hopefully it will give us a chance to make us a more of a secure and better future.Certainly the fluctuation of the dairy business will always be there, but the ability to change markets might give us the chance to go elsewhere."Ms Lomas explains: "It makes you feel a lot more positive for us."Looking down at her son Ethan, she adds: "And for him."China exports Andrew Henderson is the man who secured the deal with a hypermarket chain in Qatar.He runs a dairy called Nemi, also based in Cheshire.It bottles milk from farmers in the surrounding counties and could soon be the first in the UK to export fresh milk to China.These cows are given an enriched feed so they produce milk high in selenium, which can be in short supply in the Chinese diet.A supermarket there has just placed an order.Image caption Brand GB: A prototype of the bottle that could carry the first British fresh milk to China.Note the gold Houses of Parliament and British flag."Brexit is having a very positive effect - we have farmers who are getting a much better milk price and we also have more interest from countries inside Europe and outside Europe for fresh British milk.We are trying to supply that need."He says the Chinese are interested in British milk because they see it as "pure".They also want to know exactly which farm the product is coming from."We were in China in June and we were sitting with some highly decorated officials from the Chinese government and they made a point of saying it's very easy to do a deal with one country - but very difficult to do a deal with 27."Would this be happening without the Brexit vote?"I believe not.There was no will from the major European cooperatives and organisations to deliver our fresh milk to China as they are already within those markets with dried milk and other products from Europe," says Mr Henderson.His business partner is Mark Langslow, from County Milk Products."Regarding Brexit, I think we've made the right decision.I think it makes us want to stand on our own two feet, and forces us to stand on our own two feet."Image caption Dairy farms are closing because they can't find able staff to take on the roles available.However not too far away, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, David Brookes has a dairy herd of 180 cows.He's a member of the West Midlands Dairy Board.He relies on his daughter to help with the business and talks of what experts have referred to as the "shocking crisis" in the dairy labour industry."There's only around 1% on jobseekers allowance in Staffordshire.Whether it's the butchery side of things and processing meat or whether it's processing dairy products we have become reliant on a migrant labour force, mainly from Eastern Europe," he says."We need the skilled labour.And at the moment they are not coming over."He says that the devaluation of the pound is largely to blame, but also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit."One of the problems is the classification of 'labour'.Because the government is very keen to get a lot of skilled labour.A lot of our processing workers (such as those that operate milking equipment) are skilled, but their skills are not clearly defined as skilled under government guidelines," Mr Brookes explains.He believes that if restrictions are imposed "it could be very difficult".Further south, in Wiltshire, Jenny Quick helps to run a small family dairy herd."People may tell you their view," she says, "But no one knows.We just have no idea yet."Follow Claire on Twitter.
Westminster sexual harassment: MPs outline claims:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical "pub" talk.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out "sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter", as she faced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassment in Parliament.One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel "deeply uncomfortable" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored.The Labour MP said: "When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area...I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."Ms Leadsom gave her "absolute assurance" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe."There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liz Saville Roberts says she was told "distrust is endemic" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman "deeply disappointed and distrustful"."She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing," she said, adding: "She tells me that distrust is endemic."Ms Saville Roberts asked: "How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself.One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedly asked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her "sugar tits".Secret text Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being "utterly foul" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician.Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a "problem he saw in this place".He quoted the text as saying the MP was "utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."He added that the sender asked him to "do the best you can" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like "dirt".Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to an urgent question on plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman.Ms Leadsom's statement prompted "wittering about a witch hunt", according to Labour's Jess Phillips.She told the chamber: "As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM is "too weak" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed "anguish" that the allegations could "unfairly tarnish" innocent MPs.He insisted that Parliament was not a "den of inequity".Earlier, Labour MP Lucy Powell told the BBC that there was an "imbalance of power" in Westminster that left employees open to being abused."When you have that mix of lots of desperate people in that environment [you get] this sort of power abuse - because that's what it is," she said.
Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons:::::Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women?Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman.It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London.This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere."Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice.We need to be able to argue back," she said.Image copyright Rosie O'Driscoll / WHIP The "boys' club" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists.Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: "Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys.I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman?"Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair.Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry."My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper.There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid," he said, "If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one.I can only pick cartoons from what is available."My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is.Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best."I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers.I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough.I never decide on gender lines.As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers.Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s.What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib.She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum."The more we looked the more women we found.You just have to take the trouble to look.Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women," she said.There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers.As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years."There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life.Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women," explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard.Image copyright Martha Richler Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: "As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury.But the story's not over if you look online."She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online."There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon.Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw.We can self-publish.There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street.In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were "regularly rewritten by backbench executives".The paper later published an apology.Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists.Image copyright Alice Skinner / WHIP So how do things look now?Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor.The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian.Political blog The Canary has recently launched an all-female political cartoonist collective.And the second issue of Whip is due to be published next month."We're hoping to keep expanding.I hope editors will pay attention to what we are doing," Miss Bucknall said."The ultimate aim is that there will no longer be a Whip, because women are given a mainstream platform.The only reason we exist is because at the moment there isn't one."
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter

Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount

European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.
Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Image copyright PA Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords.When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling Image copyright Reuters Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet.The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2.He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley Image copyright Getty Images Karen Bradley has kept her role as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary.She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Environment Secretary - Michael Gove Image copyright EPA Michael Gove has made a comeback, with the prime minister bringing him back into cabinet and appointing him environment secretary.In the 2016 reshuffle he was sacked as justice secretary and before that he served under David Cameron as education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit, he withdrew his support for Mr Johnson to be Conservative leader and prime minister, choosing instead to stand himself.He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.Mr Gove's surprise move to stand for the leadership effectively dashed his colleague's hopes of winning and prompted Mr Johnson's withdrawal from the contest.Work and Pensions Secretary - David Gauke Image copyright AFP A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary.He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Image copyright AFP Sajid Javid keeps his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government.He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later.A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.He stood on a "joint ticket" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Northern Ireland Secretary - James Brokenshire Image copyright PA James Brokenshire continues as the Northern Ireland Secretary.He previously worked with the PM at the Home Office, where he was immigration minister.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter-terrorism.This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.Mr Brokenshire's responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's "extremism taskforce".He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Welsh Secretary - Alun Cairns Image copyright PA Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.The 46-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected in 2010.He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly.Scottish Secretary - David Mundell Image copyright Reuters David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland.He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after this snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary.Conservative Party chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster -

Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
